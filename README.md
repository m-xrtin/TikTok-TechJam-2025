Topic: Filtering the Noise: ML for Trustworty Location Reviews

## Introduction and Premise üòé

Online reviews often shape public perception of local businesses and locations, but their reliability is often compromised by spam, irrelevant content, and misleading rants. This project tackles the challenge of ‚ÄúFiltering the Noise‚Äù by building an ML-based system that evaluates the quality and relevancy of Google location reviews.

Our approach combines rule-based preprocessing (to remove obvious junk) with an LLM-powered classifier that detects policy violations (advertisements, irrelevant content, rants from non-visitors) and assigns a relevancy score. By filtering out low-quality reviews, the system helps users make better decisions, ensures fair representation for businesses, and reduces moderation workload for platforms.

The end result is a scalable pipeline that can process raw review data, output clean and trustworthy reviews, and provide evaluation metrics and a live demo.

## Requirements

Open AI API key (We will provide a temporary one for judge purposes)

## Pipeline

### 1. Taking in a data set
Our Program takes in a file (Limited to Json, csv, and txt for simplicity sake), calls the GPT API, and standardizes a JSON file with following categories:
- user_id: unique identifier for the reviewer (anonymous ID or hash; helps link multiple reviews from the same person).

- user_name: Display name of the reviewer as shown on the platform.

- business_name: Name of the restaurant or business being reviewed.

- time: Timestamp of when the review was posted, limited by the dataset.

- text: The raw content of the review (what the user actually wrote).

- rating: Numerical star rating provided by the user (1-5).

- sentiment_category: For the first part of our project, this is solely determined by the numerical rating (1-2 : negative, 3 : neutral, 4-5 : positive)

- rating_category: Review type, such as taste, menu, indoor/out-door environment, we use AI to infer when dataset doesn't provide.

- gmap_id: Unique Google Maps identifier for the restaurant/business location.

### 2. Proper Pre-processing
