Topic: Filtering the Noise: ML for Trustworty Location Reviews

## Introduction and Premise üòé

Online reviews often shape public perception of local businesses and locations, but their reliability is often compromised by spam, irrelevant content, and misleading rants. This project tackles the challenge of ‚ÄúFiltering the Noise‚Äù by building an ML-based system that evaluates the quality and relevancy of Google location reviews.

Our approach combines rule-based preprocessing (to remove obvious junk) with an LLM-powered classifier that detects policy violations (advertisements, irrelevant content, rants from non-visitors) and assigns a relevancy score. By filtering out low-quality reviews, the system helps users make better decisions, ensures fair representation for businesses, and reduces moderation workload for platforms.

The end result is a scalable pipeline that can process raw review data, output clean and trustworthy reviews, and provide evaluation metrics and a live demo.
