    "text": "The international summer employees treat the customers like we're inconvinceing them. They are very unfriendly every time I go in. It's amazing if they get my order right, I'm even okay with it if they don't add extra onions like I ask if they manage to do that. In the drive threw they take forever to get to you and then they don't listen to what you order, when you try to correct the order they flat out don't care and tell you to proceed to the next window. We've left 3 times without even finishing our order out of frustration with the lack of care from the employees. This has been my experience every time on the pm shift that I've gone there, Even when they aren't even busy. id have to say that This is the worst McDonald's ever. I'm not even rude to them or ordering rediculious things. I hope to have a better winter experience because I do enjoy eating the food every now and then. I just hate getting treated so badly when I'm spending good money.",

Myself and a colleague. GAME OVER. Burgers will never meet the benchmark set by this wonderful group of people who serve it well.\n\nThe menu, is outstanding and will feed even the pickiest of eaters. I have 4 girls so I know. I will be going back for dinner with them.\n\nThings to note. Open time 11:30 get there early or on time. Pre-order if you can. Take out at starts at 1pm.\n\nThe restaurant is clean. The atmosphere is beautiful and classic Alaska holds strong here. If you need a history lesson about 4th ave and Anchorage downtown CHEECHAKOS, this is the place to be. If I could give 10 stars CLUB PARIS WOULD GET JUST THAT. Today's date June 2 2017!\n\nGive Eileen a call and tell her this Sourdough since 73 sent ya.\n\nThis is my first time going and I should have been going there A LONG TIME AGO!",

My experience with Fix Auto Gambell was the most dreadful experience I have had with any automotive shop to date. Before I say anymore, the customer service representatives were pleasant and easy to work with.  Everyone else including the Fix Auto Corporation was appalling inept.My truck had minor to moderate damage. The truck had a completion estimate of 30 days to be fixed.  I dropped my truck off on July 9th 2020.\nOn October 29th 2020, 112 days later I picked up my truck completely dissatisfied. Parts were missing, little to no quality control,  Scratches all over truck interior ect. I ended up having to take my truck to a different shop to have them fix everything Gambell had messed up. I will never be working with and never recommend anyone to go to Fix Auto Gambell ever.",

We were weary and worn, but his hospitable personality picked us right up. We let him know that we were aware that we were 14 hours premature for check in, but during the course of conversation my husband mentioned that we were on our anniversary vacation. At that point, he said, \"Would you mind changing  rooms? I have one available if you like - and you can take it now. It is a corner suite, an upgrade.  Happy anniversary!\" Despite our tiredness from traveling from Florida that day, we were so grateful for his upgrade. The accommodations were delightful and the corner rooms - with wall to wall windows and views - were such a treat. Huge thanks to Joshua!",

The Fettuccini Alfredo and Penne Alfredo were lack luster.  The calzone was okay but have had better at other restaurants.  The bread sticks and french fries were great.\n\nIt may have been an off day but remember Piccolinos being better.",

It may be small islands or snow clad mountains. One such paradise is whole of Alaska in  USA. Feeling virtually  the places by Google Maps, the landscape is mesmerizingly beautiful. Never miss Mount Susitna located in Anchorage Alaska. Mount Susitna is often called The Sleeping Lady for its resemblance to a recumbent woman. It is a 1,340 m mountain. It is located on the west bank of the lower Susitna River, about 53 km northwest of Anchorage, Alaska.The mountain is a prominent landmark in the Anchorage area and can be seen across the Knik Arm of the Cook Inlet from most of the city, especially at higher elevations.\nOnce aviation sector is back to normal, after the new Corona is tamed, Alaska  with its snow clad mountains will surely be a paradise on earth to visit. Good luck.",

This tour surpassed all my wildest expectations.\n\nWe first climbed on a huge 6 wheeler truck, road through very rough terrain and then crossed several flowing creeks for around 4 miles.then we hopped on to a speed boat and blasted over the knik river that was full of floating icebergs for around 4 miles. And suddenly, we were face to face with the huge knik glacier.\n\nThe journey to the glacier was unbelievable.\n\nThe tranquility and the sight of the glacier was unreal.\n\nThe tour company has a small camp on dry ground where they took us for a hot chocolate.\n\nWe spend time around the glacier taking in its beauty and serenity.\n\nOur two guides were exceptional and courteous blokes.\n\nOUTSTANDING EXPERIENCE - NOT TO BE MISSED",

Dr. Swensen was awesome.  He took a lot of time to really explain things to me, and to make me feel comfortable and understand what needed to be done.   At checkout the women who helped me schedule my next appointment (Jen?) was super friendly, and so nice too!  It was the most pleasant experience I've ever had at a dentist!  I've referred all my friends to him!  It's nice to go somewhere where customer service is still important and they do a fabulous job at it!",

I drove off after they had given me the food at the drive-thru (since 99% of places hand you your card back before giving you your food) and had called once I realized it. He wasn't very rude over the phone, but once I came back he was very rude at the window. When I asked about the raffle he shruggingly pointed at the box that I couldn't reach and didn't even give me a pen. Didn't offer me a pen the first time either, or give any kind of signal such as \"just a moment.\" What I find really disrespectful is that I was not rude about it at all, and was trying to be friendly.",

But most of their merchandise is priced more than a brand new item when I start googling them or checking it at amazon or eBay. I’m not stupid, I’ve been to the other pawn shops in Fairbanks and they’re ‘reasonably’ priced or you can make a deal, but compared to the rest of the same ‘place’ this is by far the most expensive pawn shops in Fairbanks.",

    "text": "This guy (Ron) canceled my reservation the same day he charged my card....\nI sent these guys an email a week or two ago asking about availability for August. We emailed back and forth a bit then I just called because I thought that would be easier. Everything seemed to be peachy. So he told me to send an email requesting specific dates and a \"formal request\" so I did. No issues. He told me he would send me a confirmation and then to contact him with a credit card to hold my reservation.\nThis is where things start getting odd.\nI called him as soon as I received the email. He told me he was tied up and to call him back later because he would inevitably forget. Okay, a bit unprofessional but whatever.\nI was unavailable so my partner contacted him. We wanted to ask some questions about adding a driver, some of the equipment that is supposed to be included and a few other things. He was apparently too busy to answer questions and told my partner to Contact him in the morning.\nThen he sent me an email later that day saying if I didn't give him the credit card information he was going to cancel my reservation request.\nI responded as soon as I saw it saying, why would you do that? I've tried to give you my credit card twice and you weren't available to help me.!\nI called him right away and he told me that my partner never offered to give the credit information, which is not true. I thought that was really odd but told him we still wanted to confirm our reservation if it was still available and chalked it up to a misunderstanding.\nToday, I got the contract and noticed the vehicle has a 150 miles per day limit.\nOkay, I'm wanting to do more driving than that so I called and left a message telling him my planned route and asking about adding miles.\nHe called me back and just went off. Right out of the gate telling me one of the places on my planned destination (Eagle) was off road and that I'd be breaching contract.\nI had no idea of this. And one of the reasons I was calling him was to discussion options. I honestly assumed that because it's a city it would have a paved access.\nI tried to talk to him and explain that I had never been there and I didn't know, I didn't have any intention of breaking the contract. But also in our initial email it says, \"unless previously agreed upon\" so I assumed we could have a rational conversation about what was acceptable. I was totally willing to add a fee or whatever if that was what he wanted (the initial email says you can add miles for .35. I've included screen shots)\nI was literally just trying to be upfront and ask questions from a professional. But this guy is definitely not a professional.\nInstead of talking to me he was yelling and going off. I asked if I could speak to Ashleigh, (who is the other name on the email) because we were both frustrated and I felt we needed another party in the discussion. So of course he just said \"we're done\" and hung up the phone.\nAnyways, I said all that to say, dude is kinda shady and at the very least unprofessional.",

We recently purchased our second vehicle from them and could not be happier with the entire process.  We always feel like Kendall rolls out the red carpet for us and we highly recommend them to everyone we know.  We have kept in touch with Louie Hasipi for the past few years as he sold us our original vehicle back in 2015.   Louie's family was welcoming a new baby to the family during our purchasing week and he still made the time to text and email from home and make sure we were taken care of.  We love our new Tacoma and will be back again soon!  Thank you!!",

After a short look through the lot, Allen Ellison helped us narrow it down to a great Jeep Renegade Trailhawk. He was very friendly, helpful but most importantly, laid-back.\nI don't like push salespeople and Anchorage Chrysler definitely exceeded my expectations as far as salespeople, vehicle selection, and overall ease of the car-buying process. I never felt pressured into a car i didn't want. I would absolutely recommend anyone to Allen Ellison as well as the Anchorage Chrysler Dodge Jeep center.",

I needed my shield repaired and they did a great job. After I drove around for a few days I realized that the rearview mirror was a lot lower than my previous windshield (it's how it came from the factory).  So I took it in and they tried to adjust it with no luck. They were going to try taking off the mirror using heat (which can sometimes crack the whole window).  So they ordered a NEW windshield for me to have on hand in case it cracked.  I was told that even if it did crack, I would not be responsible for any of the costs.  It wasn't even there \"fault\" (it was how the factory made the window) and they took full responsibility.  The window did not crack and they fixed the problem.  And they even gave me a certificate for a free chip repair because of the \"hassle\" I went through.  Which came in quite handy because 2-3 weeks later another rock hit my window.  I called them and they got me in within 30 minutes.  They are extremely nice and helpful.  Their waiting room is clean and they have wifi. I brought 2 small kids with me each time I had to go.  I would recommend them to anyone for any project/service.",
