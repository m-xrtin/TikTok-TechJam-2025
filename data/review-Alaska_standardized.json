It took over 40 minutes to receive the order and then our company couldn't even eat it and had to take it in a to go container as the service took far to long. We sat and watched others that had been seated after us get their orders before we even got our appetizer. 1 star because there wasn't an option for 0.",

She had to call her boss 3 times to get help checking us in. I had paid online before hand, but was charged a second time. I was told I was was swiping my card for accidentals, but instead was charged the full amount again. After a long day of traveling, the whole experience was very frustrating.\nWe stayed another night, booking it before our first experience, at the end of our trip and although check-in was smoother, a housekeeping staff member walked right into our room just after I had gotten out the shower. No knocking to check if there was anyone there.\nThe room itself was okay, but the walls are paper thin and you can here everything. Overall, this place lacks management and training and I'd advise spending the money to stay some where else.",

In addition, my girlfriends drinking glass was dirty and since the waiter didn't check on us for a while it took forever to get another glass. The place was busy, but from what I was able to gather, they are busy frequently.  Overall, I really regret going here.  Alaska is very expensive in general and I was only in Juneau for a few days.

We brought her in to this vet office and they were so nice, caring, and sympathetic. We did end up having to put her down but they told us we could spend as much time as we needed in the room with her before we had to do it and never once rushed us or told us we had to do this now. When the time came, they made plaster paw prints for our kids. These are amazing people and I commend them for the job they do. Great place, great people. Thank you to the caring staff.",

Mike emphasized his mission to gain customers for life rather than a one stop shop experience. My truck got rammed while it was parked so I had some minor dents on the back end of it. Mike wanted to see if he can take out the dents even before I made the commitment to work with them, free of charge. I knew I found the shop I wanted to work with, the work they did on my truck is amazing! You wouldn't be able to tell it was damaged by looking at it. If you ever need work done on your vehicle I would highly recommend Mirage Auto Painting & Collision! You will not regret your decision.",

Sense the registers are behind a wall and the only way to exit the register area is to walk out or back through the line asking a cashier anything is just about impossible.\n\nOther than that they had way better variety of crafts than the joanns out in wasilla. We also found diamond painting kits which have been impossible to find in stores and the variety of what they had was amazing. They were a bit more expensive than ones you can find online but I'm willing to pay the extra price because shopping for them online can be a gamble.",

    "text": "My first time here during the mandates by the mayor banning indoor dining. The food was reasonably good.  However we were ordered ground beef in our salad and received shredded which included an upcharge.  We also were not informed that using a credit card would result in a credit card fee. Although not unreasonable at 3% (standard rate charged by credit card companies to the business) this is the only place we had encountered the charge and there were no signs or information regarding this charge provided before or during our meal.  We only knew about it at the end of our meal when we saw it listed on the receipt.  While we want to help out local businesses trying to stay alive through all this, correct orders and full cost disclosures are important as well.",

    "text": "Terrible management. I made reservation months in advance. We were on our way to the hotel from Talkeetna on August 17th 2019 and should have arrived at 5PM. We encounter a forest fire and the ONLY road to Anchorage was closed and were told road will be closed indefinitley. I called the hotel to cancel our reservation and explain our unforseen circumstances. The gal on phone was rude and told me the hotel requires 24 hour notice and can not cancel. I asked to speak to the manager. The gal took my cell phone number and would have the manager call us back.\nNo one called us back. I called back and manager was still not available....REALLY.\nWe sat in the road block for over 5 hours. The road opened around 1100PM and arrived to hotel around 1:30AM and encountered another rude employee. By time we settled in and fell asleep 2:30AM and woke up at 9:15 Am and ran down the hall to get coffee or something to eat for we had not eaten due to being stuck on the highway.\nThe door to serving area was closed. I knocked and opened the door and saw about 5 employees sitting on the counters eating the food. We were told there was no more food or coffee and closed the door on me. RUDE!\nRoom- leaking shower that allowed water to leak into the bedroom and forcing us to  walk on the wet carpet. GROSS!\nCouch was dirty with crusty stains.\nI responded to a survey for hotel conveying my experience and Management's repsonse was \"Thank you for the valuable feedback. We have shared your response with the appropriate hotel team.\" WHAT!\nThis past weekend we stayed at HILTON for 3 days. When checking out, we were asked if there were any issue with our stay. I said just things out of the hotel's control with children running around in room above ours until after midnight 2 nights. They were so apologetic and insistent of crediting our account with 2000 Hilton points.\nTHAT IS HOW MANAGEMENT HANDLES ISSUES MARRIOTT!\nToday management has written a response that have made several attempts to call me. I have never recieved a call from said management!",

    "text": "We’ve been your customer for a very long, but it’s getting very much annoying of how you treat your customers.\nWe placed a large order recently. First of all- again, the salmon cuts are out of shape and not at the same weight, and second- half of the salmon vacuum packs were not vacuumed properly- it wasn’t vacuumed all around the edges of salmon piece, but rather having all air inside. I’m questioning now the quality of those pieces during the shipping. I think that after paying so much money, one would hope their perishable item will be handled with care.\nAlso, just a side note, there is nothing wrong with it- but I wish scallops were packed in a smaller pre-packs. Now once it’s opened, it will need to be eaten at once. And there quite a lot of them in one pack.\n\nAnd one more upsetting moment- once we place a large order, you always sent to us a coupon for discount, knowing that the customer already made a purchase. It’s like laughing at their faces! Vitacost used to do it, we are no longer their customer! Instead of taking care of your valuable customers, you just laugh at their faces... and you might say you gave us discount at the first place, but let’s be honest- first you raise the prices and then you sent a discount code to everyone. It’s been a pattern for some time. Do you really think that’s how you should treat your returning customers?",

    "text": "My husband takes his truck here for some of his oil changes and this year we bought studded tires here and had them mounted and balanced and put on the vehicle. When we bought the tires during change over season they said for me to leave them there over night and they would mount and balance the tires to our winter rims and we could come in and get them put on our truck the next day. I left our rims and old tires with them and after the new tires (which we got a discount/special on) got put on the next day I noticed that the wheel covers were missing and was told that they were not on the rims when we brought them in when in fact they were. When the tires were put on the tire monitor system was not hooked up or reset so the notification is always displayed. We have not had a chance to head back to Midas to have them check it out.\n\nOther than the issue with our winter rims and tire sensors, this is a good, quick place to get your oil changed and they usually have a special or coupon that can be used too.",

We stopped while we were christmas shopping and they said they could not get us in, which i understand on a holiday saturday afternoon.\nSo i really wanted to try them because the atmosphere just seemed so much nicer and relaxing than the other places ive been to in fairbanks.\nStopped at 2pm on a thursday afternoon in march to get a pedicure. The shop had 5 people getting manicures and no one that i could see back in the pedicure chairs. The receptionist said it would be a 45 minute wait. So i made an appt for 45 minutes from then and said i would be back. Went and killed time in town.\nCame back in 40 minutes and the receptionist said to have a seat. I waited for 30 more minutes and then went and told them it wasnt worth it to wait any longer and left.\nNot worth the wait!",

I brought my daughter in on a Thursday trying to figure out what the schedule was because their website does not work on mobile devices. They told me that they were not that technologically advanced enough to be able to use mobile phone websites. So I got a paper schedule from them showing their on Saturday they are open from noon to 1:30 for public scate. So I brought my daughter in at noon on Saturday. she has been excited all week to go ice skating and I find out the schedule that they gave me and the one an a huge board at the rink is not what they're going by. They are only going by the hockey schedule and they have hockey all day which they planned out on Wednesday somehow even though they were closed Wednesday. I understand that the majority of the money they make comes from hockey but thats still no excuse for the way they operate. If you're gonna go to this rink for open skate call ahead and do not trust the schedule or what they tell you.",

Like...if I knew what I was doing, do you think I'd be here asking you for help?!? No, I'd be fixing it myself! The guys at Trek have never made me feel like that. And I have asked some dumb questions, I'm sure. I also like how the Trek store will service any bike, not just their own brand. And getting service done is so affordable! Anyway, a post-service survey asked me how likely I am to recommend Trek Bicycle store to a friend, and my real answer is that I already have. You guys are awesome. Keep it up!",

    "text": "Pointless stop on our Alaskan cruise route via the Norwegian Jewel. I'd bet Norwegian has an interest, if not full ownership of this \"port\". Basically they offer overpriced excursions that will be better at other ports along the route. Our 7 day cruise had 4 port days. Icy Strait Point was our first port and we had a FULL day there. The \"port\" has nothing to do if you don't book an excursion outside of a 20 minute walking path through some admittedly pretty forest. They offer a Zip line that is better suited for a theme park. Other ports along the way have zip line tours over a few hours. This is a zip line that last seconds.\n\nAfter over 8 hours in Icy Strait Point we got 4 hours in Alaska's capitol city of Juneau.\n\nIn short icy Strait Point is a cash grab by the cruise line on their captive audience. There is a reason you can't find this place on a map.",

In September of 2019 my girlfriend and I purchased a couch a love seat and recliner which was not a cheap purchase mind you. Right off the get go there was something was wrong with couch which they did to there credit come out right away to fix it. Fast forward to the beginning of December I noticed tears on the love seat and recliner. They came out took pictures telling us it was a manufacturer’s defect that they would probably have to get is a new couch. which after telling me it going through insurance my girlfriend and I purchased then two weeks later it going through store which took forever. Meaning they came to a decision by mid January that they were going to replace them. The told us for our trouble that they would give us 5% off that was the best they could do. My girlfriend and I picked out new piece of furniture which they were out of told us it would be in sometime in March. Then they told us that they wanted the couches back to resell which I had said no\nProblem I just need furniture now for my family to sit somewhere on. After 3 days they came back told us we could hang on to the couches till the new ones arrive. Fast forward to this week I get a call Monday the new couches are in. I told them great could you deliver them Saturday. They said yes. Then today the day before they are suppose to deliver the new couches they tell us oh we lost one of the pieces to your couch do you still want us to bring it over missing it. I replied no. So now it will be another two weeks till that piece comes in and my girlfriend and I get our new couch. I can’t believe the service especially of a local company that is suppose to look out for Alaskans!!!!",

I also asked if there was an extension option if needed (I'm shipping my truck across country and didn't know when it was coming in, she said yeah you can pay the interest amount and extend it 2 weeks. So she confirmed that on Friday we could call and extend if we needed to. On Friday I woke up to a check that had been submitted to our account from them prior to any funds posting and as such the check was rejected. I called to extend and was informed that I would have to wait until the rejection was finalized. Called on Saturday  and was informed of the same thing, I called Sunday and was informed that my account had been sent to COLLECTIONS! I was told that it is no longer with Cash America Pawn and I would have to deal with the agency now.\n\nI am extremely upset that despite trying to stay in good standing and being reassured of the steps that I was going to take that they would screw me over like this. Now I have a collection agency debt on my credit that should not be there in the first place. Ridiculous! Never again with this company, for any reason.",

But seriously... you're here for pizza and beer.\n\nThere aren't a ton of options, but all of them seem to be done well, and there are equivalents of both margarita and  pepperoni pizzas. They ate genuinely wood fired, with the characteristic charring.\n\nThe dough is soft with crisped edges and a yeasty flavor, but this is a northern Italian style pizza crust, so expect a thick edge and a soft, thin center. This is not deep dish, not a firm doughy risen crust, and not a crispy thin crust. It's a hand tossed crust with premium toppings.\n\nThe flavors vary from familiar to adventurous, but nothing that seems aggressively strong in any respect.\n\nOrdering is done at the counter with delivery to tables with a great view of Seward and the harbor. They support tabs and handle large groups well. Service was pretty prompt and while there wasn't an abundance of tables, it seemed to be enough to handle the seasonal crowd.",

You can see how the management wants to make this location large enough for the animals, but also enjoyable for the public.\n\nIf you want to see the bears then arrive around feeding time.  Bring a camera with a long lens, because not all animals are right next to the fence.\n\nDrive slowly for not only safety reasons, but to minimize the amount of dust you'll lift into the air.  People and cars share much of the same area here.\n\nThe gift shop has a huge selection of gifts, so take a look.\n\nIf this review was helpful please click the Like button.",

    "text": "Today we had a once in a lifetime adventure (twice) our day started off perfectly with a greeting from our shuttle driver “Iowa” who said he didn’t drive “Badgers” and the bantering began, all In fun of course we did have him outnumbered four to one.\n\nWhen we arrived at our destinations Temsco Aviation for our helicopter excursion to site see land and walk on a Glacier. Iowa checked us in and gave  us glacier boots and preformed our safety briefing, but only following our official weigh in.\n\nOur “first” trip was a very informative ride with Pablo, he took us out on a narrated ride out to the glacier fields and back to base only to be told we could not land due to weather constraints. A bit disappointed we went back inside to remove our boots and to our surprise we were offered a refund or the opportunity to re-schedule.\n\nWe chose the latter and returned later in the day. After the weather cleared we were once again led to our helicopter were this time we meet a real “ rock star” Rachel. She was absolutely amazing from the get go, always smiling and willing to share her knowledge of Alaska and her adventures that landed her with her dream job of flying folks like us to see this absolutely breathtaking place she calls her office.\n\nAfter twenty minutes of stunning beauty, Rachel picked out the perfect spot to land, and our once in a lifetime journey began. stepping out of a helicopter onto glacier ice is something I will never forget. Ice as deep as 1500 feet below our feet, glacier rock deposits and areas of endlessly deep sink holes left us  “almost” speechless. Rachel offered, and took photos of our group, then we finished exploring this  breathtaking piece of heaven on earth at the foot of Mount  Deborah. Rachel then treated us to a drink from a glacier stream possibly over a hundred years in the making.\n\nWould I go back?  Absolutely!!  I would recommend Temsco Aviation without the slightest hesitation. every person we encountered from the shuttle drivers, ground personnel, to the pilots were all simply fantastic, smiles on their faces, willing to share their stories and  experiences. You can tell how much they loved their jobs and sharing this part of Alaska with us. Anyone who is even considering taking a helicopter glacier tour from Denali, forget the rest, take the best, Temsco Tours and if you’re  really lucky your pilot will have  a very big smile on her face and her name tag will say Rachel.\n\nSent from my iPad",

Second our room smelled like a wet dog and there was dog hairs all over the carpet. In addition, our first night there I killed a coach roach that came out from under our bed. The toilet was loose at the bottom where it’s anchored to the floor but, it was concerning because when you sat down it moved. Of course we reported all of this to the front desk when we checked out. I would not recommend staying at this place. And, for the price of this room, it’s disappointing to pay this much for a mediocre facility! 😡\nDisappointed in Anchorage,  Room 1025.The Lewis’s",

The staff at Mayo’s recommended Dr. Glass in Anchorage for my care here. While at Mayo I asked if I should return every 6 months or so for a follow up assessment. They said that was not needed if I was a patient of Dr. Glass. I have been completely satisfied thoroughly with my care at Peak Neurology. Dr Glass is a very patient listener and communicator. He not only is a skilled in the practice of medicine; he is skilled at the art of medicine. The staff of Peake Neurology is also very patient oriented and are polite and always very helpful.",

Our tour guide recommended this place for lunch so we came here.\n\nOverall really great experience in this really cute cafe. We ordered the Fish \"witch\", Sand Dollar Dilla, and a cup of latte. The food was really good and the fish was fresh. Portions are great too so definitely come here if you're hungry!\n\nIn terms of the store, there is a boutique gift shop when you go in, they have a lot of handmade, petite gifts that make perfect souvenirs. Upstairs seating is closed off because of Covid but there are plenty of seating on the ground floor (see photos) for you to enjoy your meal indoors. There are also heaters by the tables so you'll be cozy and warm!",

As a manager for many hears in high end customer service, I have very high expectations, and In My Element did not disappoint!!!  I came in looking for a very specific dress for my upcoming casual wedding. I was greeted by each of the ladies working in the store as I looked through the racks. They asked if I had anything specific in mind, and in fact found exactly what I was looking for even though it wasn’t currently on a rack.  I was extremely happy with the dress I bought.  All of the ladies were extremely friendly, helpful, and treated me with professionalism while at the same time making me feel like a close friend!  I highly recommend In My Element if you are looking for super cute clothes, shoes,  and accessories, with an amazing staff in a relaxed professional environment!!",

Dr. Bradstreet was equal unprofessional...the 2 stars are... 1 for Berry and 1 for Paul who where both great at their job.\nI would advise if you want more professional health care go elsewhere.

As in any fishing or hunting pursuit....weather is a major factor. The chefs they have on staff do a fantastic job preparing all 3 meals and the food was well beyond what I expected. Captain Mike is extremely knowledgeable and knows how to put you on fish. The staff, captain Mike, and the kids cleaning the fish are all very accomadating and know what they're doing. All in all, sitka point lodge is great place to experience alaska and guide you on that dream fishing excursion you've always wanted to take",

Having worked around the construction business for 42 years you get great exposure to various levels of craftsmanship and  pride, and a “window” into the people behind the work. At Neighbors Windows & Doors (NW&D) I’ve found a courteous, knowledgeable, and highly skilled staff. My standards are very high and at NW&D I find no less. It’s as if their doing an installation  in their own homes. Within the first 2 years my heating bill average reduction was 17%. THAT’S HUGE. And you know how sliding patio doors can sometimes drag in their tracks during the winter from iceing? Not true with my new slider. The new windows lowered the summer temps on the wooden floors so much our dogs no longer “sunbathed” in front of the large picture window. Recently NW&D corrected a poorly installed frameless shower door which leaked in our newly remodeled bathroom (another competitor). For the first time in 12 months when this project began am I able to finally enjoy, leak free, our shower. What was I even thinking? Thank you Steve & Dana & your ENTIRE STAFF for jobs well done and for continuing to operate at the highest levels of pride and craftsmanship. It speaks volumes to where your values lie with your customer base.",
