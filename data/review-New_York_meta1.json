My car was supposed to have gps and remote start. It took 2.5 months to get the GPS installed after getting thr run around for months. Now I'm here trying to get the remote starter installed. I took my car to the Chrysler dealership and they said the car doesnt even have remote start capabilities installed. Apparently major world made a replacement remote wit the remote start button on it but the car did not have the package installed. Been here 4.5hours already and they say they need minimum 1 more hour. Im sooooo through with this place. I'll never deal with them again!! There's no reason 5 months after purchase in still dealing with crap from this place!",

Waiters were attentive at the start but once the food arrived we felt like we were being avoided.\n\nThe food quality almost made up for this except the prices were a little much. One thing to consider would be maybe adding more vegan/vegetarian dishes to the mains. Currently you don’t have any choice but to order multiple overpriced appetizers to be full.\n\nAmbience was amazing and the design of the restaurant is beautiful.",

Brought me back in normal mode in just two days. Discharged me with copies of all my test reports, transcripts of all my treatments and follow up  instructions for me and for my primary physician in a very systematic way. They not only listen to you but they ask you all relevant questions and note down your answers.

First of all I got a brand new 2019 Infiniti Q50 Luxe, In new york it is illegal to sell a car without a bracket because according to the state of law a New York car has to have a front plate. I called this trash dealership and told them that my car came with no bracket and then they told me I had to purchase one.. How much? $60 mind you I got a car from them now they are telling me to get a bracket? Is it my fault that the car had no bracket? Both the lady and the mechanic are super nasty.. Getting a bracket $60 then $30 for labor work.. Is this a joke? They are super nasty all they want is money. I am so glad that I did not get the bracket from them and another Infiniti dealership supplied it to me for FREE and also installed it for me for FREE. Do not go here for service also do not go here to lease or buy a car. They will rip you off with a smile on their face. They tried to rip me off with $2,000 down and $500 a month for a car. Go to Jersey do not go to this trash dealership they are so nasty and tell you it’s impossible to have a $360 car payment with $1500 out of pocket. This dealership is such a joke I hope it goes out of business.",

We called Harry, and he came right out during the rain to check out the situation. Right away he offered several solutions before we deciding on taking out the whole drive way and re-paving it. Other companies probably won't do this, but Harry offered us the credit we had already paid him and repaved our driveway. And it is beautiful and exactly the way we like. Water will never back into the garage with the new driveway. We highly recommend Precision to anyone who is looking for resurfacing or repaving their driveway!",

Our salesman was Mike Tyson (yes, that's his real name) and we couldn't have asked for a better, more personal guy to work with. He made sure we not only got the best deal but the best vehicle for what we need. He went out of his way to list out all our options and to get to know us. The floor manager (Zach Smith) was also amazing. He made sure we we're happy and even stayed late at work to make sure we we're all set. We love our new truck. It feels luxurious but also functional for our house projects. This is the second great experience we had at Hoselton and will no doubt be going back in the future for our car buying needs.",

She helped us pick out Hux and made sure we were absolutely certain. We picked him up in Syracuse the following weekend and he is the light of our lives! He is so calm and sweet and loving, and I know this is all thanks to the superior breeding of Lakeshore doodles! Highly recommend :).",

I have eaten here for 25 years once a week before the pandemic and order regularly but they laughed, saying I should eat it with my hands. I know  this sounds childish but I miss the old days when restaurants cared about their regular customers. My only advice is to order by phone (not Seamless) and to be specific and also see if you can ask for someone other than Monique. The soups are better than average and they have Peking duck that is not great but quite good.",

Finally a place where I can enjoy the delights of Mediterranean Foods. They use very fresh ingredients, everything is made fresh to order. Each day I am looking forward to the next time I’ll have lunch there. I’ll be very sad to go back to work after my maternity leave for that reason!! (And to leave my baby of course! Don’t get me wrong;))\nI really can’t stand to go to fancy and overrated  places anymore where the food is so average!! Hummus Market is now in my top 3 restaurants in NYC/Brooklyn. Simple, delicious, fair prices, refined, perfectly cooked. The roasted eggplant are so soft/melting in your mouth. Rice Majadra is to die for. And so is the lentil soup!! So mouthwatering just by writing my review !!\nNice backyard in the shade.\nIf you are a foodie, go there and be adventurous! Don’t go for typical things, try what you don’t find in other Mediterranean restaurant. That’s my opinion of course, you do whatever you want;)\nJust enjoy",

Supposed to be on auto servicing for gas and they haven't refilled in 9 months which caused us to lose propane  on a weekend in July with a house full of people .  Could not feed the children that were here.  When I called was put on hold multiple times/ disconnected.  Assured it would be remedied Sunday if I called at exactly 8 am which I did.  I was then told impossible to have someone here until monday.  Hours later received a call that if I was willing to pay $300 they would have someone come \"diagnose\" the problem.  I explained there was nothing to diagnose we were out of gas.  Long story short I will not have gas until the week.  Will be cancelling my services next week.",

    "text": "This quaint gem located on Cohoes Island is certainly worth the visit.  The food is absolutely amazing and with such a wonderful variety of lebanese food you will certainly find something you enjoy.  My first visit was a little under a week ago our order consisted of the mixed sampler (Cheese, olives, Hummus ,Labneh ,Baba Ghannouj, Lebanese bread) 2 meat pies, 1 zaatar pie\n(Zaatar, olive oil, instant yeast, flour) and one spinach pie.\nNow the sampler has large portions and can easilly be a meal for two with leftovers as well. The meat pies are smaller maybe about 5 inches around but very tasty, the spinach pie was absolutely delicious however it is a smaller portion BUT i would just suggest buying 2!  The zaatar pie is massive (the size of a medium to large pizza) and filling and even with no meat its a MUST TRY, I say this because it was so good that i tried to order one on Monday....unfortunately this amazing restaurant was closed.  They had me hooked with my first bite!  I was so upset that i refused to order from a different restaurant and cooked my own food at home. Today being that yesterday didn't work out for me I immediately came home and called to place an order, I HAD TO TRY MORE ITEMS and get another Zaatar pie!  This round we tried the chicken shawarma plate, and the beef shawarma plate (there was a buy one get one free deal, which i couldn't pass up!) We also tried their baklava!  WOW the photos say it all.  This is no ordinary Lebanese Restaurant, this place is indeed a gem!  The flavor of their food is unique and makes you want more, the quality of their food is exceptional and to top that off the quantity of the food you receive is massive there is absolutely no skimping on the portions and their prices are on point, they are certainly not expensive for what you receive.  1 entre can easilly feed 2 people!  The pie prices are ideal!  Brenda (who owns the business) and her staff are very personable and super friendly...one amazing thing i must note is that they pay attention to food allergies when people inform them and they take all the precautions to make sure there is no cross contamination.  This restaurant may be my new favorite place!  Also before wrapping up this review I'd like to note that the interior is very very clean and certainly maintained.  There are a few tables for indoor dining which is a plus and the atmosphere makes you feel warm inside.  I really cant stress how impressed I am with Teta Marie's and if you have not gone yet, please call and place an order you will not be disappointed.  I know I wasn't!",

Not to mention that they made regular butter Naan taste extraordinary.\n\nThe staff was also very attentive - at one point, I was being assaulted by sun rays (I sat by the window) and a member of staff came over, without my asking, and offered to lower the shade, which more than helped.\n\nAll in all, it was a wonderful experience, and I'll visit again if ever I am in the area.",

Their dedication, patience is unmatched and I’m not just saying that. My previous schools were all scams I’m not naming names. They were not patient and scheduled all my lessons far apart and the communication was dreadful.\n\nHowever, the team here were so kind and PATIENT it’s not just a job to them. I would definitely recommend AD Driving especially if you’re anxious driver such as myself.\n\nWhen I passed my road test I was completely having a melt down prior. But my instructor let’s Nickname them August, reassured me and calmed me down and  of course everything was great in the end. So yeah 10/10",

The pool is separated by a glass wall which is nice because the pool area is humid and the party/outer area is airconditioned. They have changing rooms, hair blow dryers, showers and a machine that sucks the water out of your bathing suit to make it really dry. Pretty cool place for a swimming birthday party.",

    "text": "I dealt with Paul on three different trips. Each and every time, Paul was extremely pleasant to work with, very attentive, and very professional.\n\nAt first, I wanted to trade my scat pack but they did not know how to price it correctly and could not make the numbers work. To their defense, I was looking to trade my Dodge Charger SRT that had a higher value than any brand new Subaru so this was a bit of an unusual trade for them and understandably so. I decided to get rid of my car on my own and returned two months later to deal a straight up lease.\n\nThe second time I left due to not being able to beat a competitor's price. It turned out the competitor did not have the exact options I wanted and I decided to return and negotiate a bit more. They ended up meeting me in the middle and I think it was fair.\n\nOverall, the dealership is friendly, and informative. Paul did an excellent job at helping me make an informed decision. We test drive three different cars and closed on an outback that made most sense for me.\n\nHuge positive here! There are no bait and switch tactics, no games, and no wasted time! They truly conduct themselves in a professional matter and the tough bargain was fair but not outrageous (I.e. Being offered a price that is initially inflated by thousands of dollars to drive a long bargain). I recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a Subaru and I recommend Paul specifically based on my extremely positive experience.",

    "text": "L.A.S.T. Call Laundry Services has been picking up, washing, folding, and delivering 50-70 pounds of my boutique spa’s laundry weekly since September 2019.  They truly stand behind “One call cleans it all.” L.A.S.T. Call picks up my laundry every Saturday around 5pm once my work week is over to ensure that all of my soiled sheets, wash cloths and towels are accounted for and ready for drop off Tuesday at 3pm before my work week starts. Each time my laundry is dropped off at my boutique spa it is always fresh, folded neatly and smelling amazing. The scent is never overpowering but it truly lasts a long time.   I love how L.A.S.T. Call puts my laundry in sterile plastic bags before placing in the actual laundry bags to ensure no contamination from the spoiled laundry that was previously in it before. L.A.S.T. Call is truly a Heaven sent because I was in need of a new wash and fold service for my company. In order for me to run my business I need to have clean laundry to service my heavy client load. I spent years of washing pounds of laundry and I simply don’t have the time to dedicate it. Without L.A.S.T. Call my business cannot run smoothly. Laundry is no longer a stress for me, I trust L.A.S.T. Call and I am so glad to be a client of theirs. They have even washed my personal laundry for me when I didn’t have time to do it. They are beta testing a dry cleaning component of their company with some of my personal formal dresses. I trust L.A.S.T. Call with all of my garments. Recently, I moved my laundry from shelves to storage cabinets and L.A.S.T. Call came to help put away my entire laundry inventory. Please call them today for your pickup. It will be the “L.A.S.T. Call” that you make for all of your laundry needs. 💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦",

Even if you do call and they tell you 30 minutes you are still waiting at least 15 minutes once you get there.i mean if you have 45 minutes to kill try them, the food is awesome, but I'm not a big fan of sitting around for the better part of a hour waiting for a wrap and some fries.",

All those are true, BUT the food exceeded my expectations.\n\nNachos were pretty good. Nothing worse than nachos with liquidy nacho cheese, so melted cheese was enjoyable.\n\nGot the pick 2 combo to split with someone. Pulled chicken, Memphis spare ribs, collard greens, cheesy grits. Loved the ribs. Liked the chicken. I know there's better BBQ in NYC but I entered with tempered expectations and left satisfied.\n\nService was weak though. Took a LONG time to get drinks, and tracking down our server became an unfortunate theme. I'd go 2.5 stars if I could, but 3 it is.",
