I called the company 3 times, and was told that I would receive email updates, but to no avail.  When talked to manager last time, I asked about compensation due to waiting 12 weeks rather than the 4-6 as described.  The manager told me there was nothing they could due with payment compensation, so I asked for some other form.  He said he would send some items in the mail.  Today, I received a $1.00 water bottle and a mini bottle opener!  Way to go out of your way 911erp!!! Never again will I order from your company and word will spread through the fire communities.",

They have more cars at the other lots. What you need to do is just walk to Brooklyn Mitsubishi on 5910 chucho ac and ask for Joseph Wilner and you will be satisfy.",

The BUILDING as we called it and the good old basketball court rounded out the concrete section and 3 baseball diamonds were added to complete a childhood paradise for us.I can remember having to wait in line to get on the swings on those warm summer nights singing the newest Beatles songs at the top of our lungs. Entering high school a few years later JH was my hangout with my crew where we would go shoot hoops and check out the local girls.My summers would begin with breakfast then a stroll to the H at 9 am to shoot around at the court as my friends would start filing in short thereafter. Ah then noon it was free lunches where we waited for the younger kids to grab theres and we  grabbed the leftovers.A walk to the corner store for an ice cold GLASS BOTTLE of Pepsi and some PENNY CANDY, home for dinner and a clean shirt then off to my second home to play a little more baseball or basketball till the sun set. As we got a little older on a chosen night we would have a few beers  after dark BUT we kept it down and had garbage barrels for our UNBROKEN BOTTLES .We actually took pride in keeping our hangout clean. Then homeward bound or one of our tents or garages for a sleep out nearly every summer night and our parents had no major reason to worry.Those were different times.Innocent times, fun times and memorable times.I wouldnt trade them in for anything.What ever happened to MY WORLD..Oh how I miss it",

Dirt marks all over the bathroom and closet doors and looked like they had layers of paint over them.  TV big and nice. Beds ok with plenty of pillows. Location a little far from the action for my 8 year old to walk.  A little disappointed for a Sheraton.  Pricy for what we got for a room.",

The movers showed up on time and took 15 boxes from my apartment including other items. My partner and I saw them label 15 boxes as they were taking the boxes downstairs. I even signed a contract showing exactly 15 boxes were taken from my apartment. Upon delivery, I only received 14 back. I sent an email to their claims manager. Not only was he curt, he actually refused to acknowledge that the contract stated 15 boxes. He said the movers made a mistake to write 15 boxes there, when they only took 14 boxes to the camera of the truck and blamed me for the inconsistency and their mover’s mistake. They then asked me to make a police report to claim what is lost. Please avoid. The disrespect is not worth it.\nTo make a long story short – they will tear, steal and lose your stuff at your own expense. You will have nothing but rudeness and disrespect in addition to the stress. Avoid.",

We found out later on there was some sort of festival and that's why it was so packed. If you only want to experience the sky ride try to avoid this festival weekend. I don't believe it was mentioned at all on the sky ride website, otherwise we wouldn't have gone that weekend. We returned the 3rd weekend in October and it was an easy process without the festival traffic and crowds.",

After talking to Tony  (i guess one of the owners), seemed like he was really going to give us a great deal.  He comes back with \"great news,\" got it \"down\" to our price range for $429 a month for 72 months (not 60, which is 30,888. Mind you it was tagged for 28k ish). AND, after the 72 months we would only owe $9k! So a jeep they had listed for 28k they tried to sell me for $40k. Make sure you do your math before buying.",

Ask another staff member and you'll get a different answer. One of the cashiers tried giving me the wrong script and actually argued with another cashier who was simply trying to correct him.\n\nUpper management doesn't really seem to care how the place is being run so I'd honestly suggest going elsewhere, at least for prescriptions.",

Overall the location was great for the ball drop but the streets were blocked off and even though I was only 150 feet from the corner where I could have seen the ball drop on new year's Eve I couldn't see it. I would give it a 5 star but the lock on the door keeps giving us issues and my key takes about 30 attempts before it finally decides to let me in. They came and looked at it which was a maintenance guy who just saw if it light up and decided that it works. Dude! Change the battery.... They get low and still light up but don't have enough power to open the lock. The other thing that stops this place from having a total 5 star rating because they do deserve it is that I have to show my key every time I had to re-enter the hotel. This is not unusual for many hotels in the area but seriously if I stay a week in the same location you would think that the few people there who work the elevators to make sure you have a key would recognize you and not ask every time. I even made it a point to come directly from the elevator, make eye contact with the person, walk up and talk to them and then 6 minutes later come back by and they still didn't recognize me and make me look for the key again. I know it is there his but can't we just put the key reader on the elevator to check so we can go along our way and not stop in the flow of traffic to dig a key out. But overall, this place is very good and I will stay again and I do recommend it. The location is great and I love the older rooms because they offer a lot more space and bang for the buck.",

FORD does the oil change and tune up but does not update the state inspection. I paid $1,200 for the tune up and oil change. I return now to get the State inspection. I figure after paying $1200 previously, I would get a complimentary State inspection. In fact, Ahmed gave me the impression that I would get the inspection free, so I left my car to get the inspection only to return to get a bill for $40. I could have gone to a local mechanic shop and paid $25 for the inspection.\n\nThe FORD service center is greedy and practices thievery with customers.   Money at all cost is how they proceed.

I just want to bring to their and other people's attention the behaviors of a certain delivery person. This individual will call you and say, your delivery is outside when it is in fact not outside. He is actually 3-4 mins away and makes you wait in the cold looking for him. This has happened several times with this individual. I don't mind being called by the delivery person and being informed that my delivery is 2-3 mins away. But don't call me to tell me my delivery is outside when you are really 4 minutes from my house.

Renting in NYC is extremely stressful and difficult and it is hard to find agents of Nicolas's caliber. Throughout the entire process he was polite, understanding, patient and charismatic.  He was empathetic when it came to my budget, location requirements, wish list and concerns.  In the end, he made it happen!  He even came by a few days after I had moved in to personally bring me my mailbox key!  If you want someone who is going to get the job done and leave you happy in your new home, this is your guy!!!  Seriously, don't waste any more time, you will find no better than Nicolas G.",

You can also buy a pair of gloves at treetop. You can't take your phone with you so if you have a go pro camera with the strap, bring that with you. You can purchase a pouch for your phone that is allowed on the course and pouch is $10 which is good for getting all the pictures and videos you want of your friends and family.In terms of food its best to bring your own lunch.",

I was totally left there, ignored and in severe pain with migraine for over 4 hours. There's more, but it just happened  this past week, and don't want to give it a red flag.\n\nEnded up being in surgery once getting to my room, I mean immediately, no time to think. I could not get my meds on time, they didn't care if I was hurting, couldn't walk, I just annoyed them as did my \"roommate.\"  The nurses were rude, broken english, nervous and come to find out, most were only there for 1-2 months. Umm, not good, and without supervision.\n\nOnce I was released, I realized I was NOT given instructions on how to care for my post-op stuff. They sent me home with paperwork, but ZERO instructions. Most doctors are \"hospitalists,\" so you cannot reach one.\n\nI tried calling this morning, and they only take calls (at the followup clinic) if you are going to make a follow-up appointment OR pay your bill!\n\nMy own primary card doctor just left the area, suddenly, and now I am left hanging with a Nor'easter on the way. I could go into sepsis, and do not know what to do.\n\nI WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN! Such a shame, we'll see if they even get $10.00 a month to pay my bill.\n\nAn utter DISGRACE to the region, it's integrity of the medical profession, and their patients. It's not the first time I had a problem, last time I had had chest pain (years ago) and was considered a cardiac patient. They took blood work, walked away, never came back, no monitoring, came back 8 hours later, told me to see my cardiologist.\n\nAVOID AT ALL COSTS!",

I came back in hope they have improved these issues and they have not so I now go to Funcho’s on Main Street which has the same food quality with better service. The seating is also very limited which is a struggle if you are there for a sit down meal. The worst part is almost every time I go there they get the order wrong.

    "text": "I had high hopes for this new restaurant but sadly I can only give this a 2 star. Our server was the finest of servers we've had since moving to this area. But its a mismatch for the restaurant that she works in. We ordered 1 alcupuria, 1 papa rellena, the rabo (oxtail) and the arroz con pollo. The alcupuria tasted as if the root vegetable they used was not ripe or was used before it was ready. The side guisado sauce was too watery. The papa rellena was just ok. The oxtail was a major let down. Between it being made in a heavy tomato base verses a natural brown gravy the onions were uncooked. On the positive the white rice was good and so were the frijoles colorados. But the arroz con pollo was terrible. Frozen corn, string beans and diced carrots have no business being in the authentic classic dish. White chicken chunks were used in place of chicken meat on the bone which gives the dish so much more moisture and flavor. It was drowning in sweet peas as well. No pimento as a garnish to finish the classic. Avocado on either side was added but shouldn't have for the sake of those who have food allergies. I ordered a piece of cuero (pig skin cracklin') that comes off the pork shoulder which is supposed to be flavored with garlic and spices and is supposed to be to many a desired portion, a highlight-- a treat of a pernil dish. It was put in the friolator and delivered horribly burnt! How the chef put that out is unexplainable. My personal opinion when it comes to the type of items you place on your menu is that you should make it as authentic as the classic recipe. If you are a fusion or nouveau style restaurant let it be known in your name and your branding. I take great offense when a restaurant puts a twist on an authentic meal most specifically Hispanic food because you lose the authenticity in the translation of the dish. Additionally, pick a country and stick with it. Meaning if you want to sell Cuban sandwiches your menu should be all Cuban. Mixing the menu up to include Mexican tacos with Puerto Rican alcupurias and Colombian bandejas is reaching way to far. Stick to the classic recipes from one country and become an expert then you will not fail. The restaurant also needs a vestibule to control all the cold air that comes in from the doors.Hopefully they will change a few things around. Otherwise, I'm sorry but I don't see this restaurant sticking around for too long. I had such great hopes.",

My problem is that I was told that my alternator was the problem and was what was gonna keep killing my battery. My warranty company wouldn't allow my alternator to be changed because this Midas only offers a 90 day warranty on their alternators (which can't be helped) so i went to Jeep to get an extended warranty on it. When I got there, they had to run their own diagnosis and it came back saying nothing was wrong with my alternator. Could've saved $170...\n\nEdit: I just got a call from Midas and am very satisfied with the customer service. Although the diagnostic fee was from Jeep, I was offered mechanic services up to $220 for my troubles which is more than generous. I'm glad I can continue getting work on my car done here.",

The man in the front window was rude and had no idea what we were talking about due to the thick glass between us. He looked annoyed whenever I asked a question. Not a good experience. I was suppose to stay 3 nights but ended up leaving after one night. Just a horrible experience. Literally felt scared for my life the whole night and the door only had one lock which shouldn’t even couldn’t as a lock to tell you the truth.

They also forgot to bring us our appetizer until an hour later when they realized the order didn’t go through. The food itself is very salty. Also, the poor ventilation in the restaurant means that you’ll end up with smoke in your eyes so if you’re irritable, I’d steer clear.",

But you have to ask yourself is any bagel worth almost a two-hour wait. All ingredients seem very tasty, and you may think it's worth it. The best way to go about this it's just order your sandwich online and pick it up that will save you the trouble. There is no table service here so keep that in mind when you come here. My biggest disappointments of the restaurant was that any hot sandwich is heated in the microwave. We were ready to have the Lox, and eggs and when we saw the ace being being in a tray and put into a microwave oh, that was a complete turn-off and opted for a cold sandwich. Yes, the bagels are amazing. I think probably one of the best that I've had in New York. You can see them being baked right in front of you once you're inside the deli. If you do not want to wait for a long time, just walk right in and buy your bagels only and take him home and do as you wish. When I come back? Yes, but only if I order ahead online I would not get in line again for a sandwich.",

Drive through team was prompt and courteous and still had patience after the half hour onslaught of over-heated, hungry and rushing workforce lunch-breakers and kids on summer break.  And I'm sure that what I witnessed was just the tail end of it. If this were a review of the customers, subtract 4 stars. But, the food was hot and fries fresh and soft but not soggy. I asked for honey mustard and amazingly it was in the bag. So, for service and product as expected, I feel 5 stars is most appropriate. It is more often then not that I walk away with something to gripe about. Daily incidentals can drag down a mood and raise stress levels; It's wonderful when they're positive and uplifting but I'm always happy to settle for neutral.  For the decent, forgettable experience I long for when buying lunch, this now tops my list.  Thanks to the Wendy's employees.",

I really don't like banks that are not customer friendly, not towards the customer but more towards the protection of their money. I don't like calling customer service who can't answer my questions and keep passing you from one rep to another because they are higher up and MIGHT be able to answer my question. This is covid times here, scams are running wild. Chase is suppose to protect the customer, not by taking a pending check from another bank and clearing it, then reversing it 3 days later, wiping out their customers account. You are suppose to either keep it in pending so the customer doesn't take it or at very very least,  tell the customer this doesn't officially clear for 3 to 4 days. A few simple words go a long way. Please Chase rep, don't tell me these scams are common and happen, that doesn't make me happy. You're the bank, you know more details of the inner workings of the bank then me. Do more and refund my money, retrain your staff, protect the customer or just get out of the business and close shop. How many more people have to lose their money????",

There are at least three bars in it if you like, and there are VIP areas where you can sit on couches that are slightly elevated on the floor, so no straining to see over general admission.  Sometimes the music makes it hard to hear the lyrics but it's easy to see the stage no matter where you are. Definitely a favorite.  Seats are slightly narrow, so if you have a larger derriere, you may want to opt for the VIP seating.",

I ask the lady WHO WANTS COLD FOOD” And she has a very NASTY ATTITUDE. So at 7:40pm I cancel the order and order Popeyes     ‍♀️.

I already had been waiting few weeks just to see a doctor and when my appointment is in few days the doctor decides to go on a vacation like WTH !! If he would be gone why would you even give an appointment in the first place ?? Someone's health depends on this if you cannot do your part then why would you still be in business.",

It seems very clear that if not all these reviews are from the friends and business partners and not actual customers as I know firsthand how they tend to a customer. They are completely unprofessional, rude and do not listen to the needs of the actual homeowners and try to interpret the bylaws as they see fit even when faced with facts. They tend to deflect responsibility when the issue is tough. This is not a good sign of leadership. They try and play the game that they take pride in customer care and provide a service, but this is not the truth. When they don’t like what they hear even if its facts, they will cut you off on responding or downplay and deflect. They will deflect and say they are given directives by a Board to which they follow, however the bylaws are the management documents that must be followed!\n\nIf you are a homeowner for a property they manage, I would excise your right in a civil manner to asked them about the health of your community, financials, and any other important information as a stakeholder of your property to insure they are doing the right thing. I’m sure they will try to downplay this rating and your concerns!\n\nEdit/update: There response is typical and proves what I have stated above in there deflecting of what they don't like to hear or can't handle.",
