"We always stay here when in Valdez for silver salmon fishing. The elderly couple that run it are amazing to talk to, extremely helpful. The campsites are very well maintained.",109129804842686204152,,1566331951619,,0x56b646ed2220b77f:0xd8975e316de80952,,positive,5
This was an amazing RV camping experience with good electric water - the owner even pumped our septic. They have a great little store with groceries and souvenirs.,108233908345184666082,,1503373018846,,0x56b646ed2220b77f:0xd8975e316de80952,,positive,5
