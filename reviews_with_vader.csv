Showed up about a week later and was seen within 10 minutes for bloodwork with a couple people ahead of me. I still havent done the sleep study, but that's laziness on my part. They have followed up to check on me about it.

I walked in with only a week experience before I started and the 8 hr class and the driving instructor Greg I drove with for 2 hrs a day for 4 day that taught and instructed me was really cool calm and professional . They helped me gain the knowledge, and to feel more comfortable behind the wheel and let me know more to what to expect on the road. I passed with flying colors within a few week.

Mike emphasized his mission to gain customers for life rather than a one stop shop experience. My truck got rammed while it was parked so I had some minor dents on the back end of it. Mike wanted to see if he can take out the dents even before I made the commitment to work with them, free of charge. I knew I found the shop I wanted to work with, the work they did on my truck is amazing! You wouldn't be able to tell it was damaged by looking at it.

However we were ordered ground beef in our salad and received shredded which included an upcharge.  We also were not informed that using a credit card would result in a credit card fee. Although not unreasonable at 3% (standard rate charged by credit card companies to the business) this is the only place we had encountered the charge and there were no signs or information regarding this charge provided before or during our meal.  We only knew about it at the end of our meal when we saw it listed on the receipt.  While we want to help out local businesses trying to stay alive through all this, correct orders and full cost disclosures are important as well.",0,La Mex,112807187334614329843,1598647142967.0,3.0,0.9349,positive

We were on our way to the hotel from Talkeetna on August 17th 2019 and should have arrived at 5PM. We encounter a forest fire and the ONLY road to Anchorage was closed and were told road will be closed indefinitley. I called the hotel to cancel our reservation and explain our unforseen circumstances. The gal on phone was rude and told me the hotel requires 24 hour notice and can not cancel. I asked to speak to the manager. The gal took my cell phone number and would have the manager call us back.
No one called us back. I called back and manager was still not available....REALLY.
We sat in the road block for over 5 hours. The road opened around 1100PM and arrived to hotel around 1:30AM and encountered another rude employee. By time we settled in and fell asleep 2:30AM and woke up at 9:15 Am and ran down the hall to get coffee or something to eat for we had not eaten due to being stuck on the highway.
The door to serving area was closed. I knocked and opened the door and saw about 5 employees sitting on the counters eating the food. We were told there was no more food or coffee and closed the door on me. RUDE!
Room- leaking shower that allowed water to leak into the bedroom and forcing us to  walk on the wet carpet. GROSS!
Couch was dirty with crusty stains.
I responded to a survey for hotel conveying my experience and Management's repsonse was ""Thank you for the valuable feedback. We have shared your response with the appropriate hotel team."" WHAT!
This past weekend we stayed at HILTON for 3 days. When checking out, we were asked if there were any issue with our stay. I said just things out of the hotel's control with children running around in room above ours until after midnight 2 nights. They were so apologetic and insistent of crediting our account with 2000 Hilton points.
THAT IS HOW MANAGEMENT HANDLES ISSUES MARRIOTT!
Today management has written a response that have made several attempts to call me. I have never recieved a call from said management!",0,SpringHill Suites by Marriott Anchorage University Lake,100532118607176495538,1569698540068.0,1.0,-0.9797,negative

We placed a large order recently. First of all- again, the salmon cuts are out of shape and not at the same weight, and second- half of the salmon vacuum packs were not vacuumed properly- it wasn’t vacuumed all around the edges of salmon piece, but rather having all air inside. I’m questioning now the quality of those pieces during the shipping. I think that after paying so much money, one would hope their perishable item will be handled with care.
Also, just a side note, there is nothing wrong with it- but I wish scallops were packed in a smaller pre-packs. Now once it’s opened, it will need to be eaten at once. And there quite a lot of them in one pack.

And one more upsetting moment- once we place a large order, you always sent to us a coupon for discount, knowing that the customer already made a purchase. It’s like laughing at their faces! Vitacost used to do it, we are no longer their customer! Instead of taking care of your valuable customers, you just laugh at their faces... and you might say you gave us discount at the first place, but let’s be honest- first you raise the prices and then you sent a discount code to everyone. It’s been a pattern for some time. Do you really think that’s how you should treat your returning customers?",0,Wild Alaska Salmon & Seafood,109445410640157025674,1598366660886.0,1.0,0.9885,positive

I left our rims and old tires with them and after the new tires (which we got a discount/special on) got put on the next day I noticed that the wheel covers were missing and was told that they were not on the rims when we brought them in when in fact they were. When the tires were put on the tire monitor system was not hooked up or reset so the notification is always displayed. We have not had a chance to head back to Midas to have them check it out.

So i really wanted to try them because the atmosphere just seemed so much nicer and relaxing than the other places ive been to in fairbanks.
Stopped at 2pm on a thursday afternoon in march to get a pedicure. The shop had 5 people getting manicures and no one that i could see back in the pedicure chairs. The receptionist said it would be a 45 minute wait. So i made an appt for 45 minutes from then and said i would be back. Went and killed time in town.
Came back in 40 minutes and the receptionist said to have a seat. I waited for 30 more minutes and then went and told them it wasnt worth it to wait any longer and left.

I brought my daughter in on a Thursday trying to figure out what the schedule was because their website does not work on mobile devices. They told me that they were not that technologically advanced enough to be able to use mobile phone websites. So I got a paper schedule from them showing their on Saturday they are open from noon to 1:30 for public scate. So I brought my daughter in at noon on Saturday. she has been excited all week to go ice skating and I find out the schedule that they gave me and the one an a huge board at the rink is not what they're going by. They are only going by the hockey schedule and they have hockey all day which they planned out on Wednesday somehow even though they were closed Wednesday. I understand that the majority of the money they make comes from hockey but thats still no excuse for the way they operate. If you're gonna go to this rink for open skate call ahead and do not trust the schedule or what they tell you.,0,Harry J.

Hands down, this place first met and exceeded expectations and we keep coming back because they are respectful to their customers, and fulfill orders the way you ordered. Like that's there job right? But again, in Juneau this was a pleasant surprise. Great tasting pizza, prices beat mostly every other pizza joint in down, and the quality is great. Keep it up Papa Johns, we want you to stick around for a very long while.",0,Papa John's Pizza,109821508151421933461,1526675788874.0,5.0,0.9784,positive

In September of 2019 my girlfriend and I purchased a couch a love seat and recliner which was not a cheap purchase mind you. Right off the get go there was something was wrong with couch which they did to there credit come out right away to fix it. Fast forward to the beginning of December I noticed tears on the love seat and recliner. They came out took pictures telling us it was a manufacturer’s defect that they would probably have to get is a new couch. which after telling me it going through insurance my girlfriend and I purchased then two weeks later it going through store which took forever. Meaning they came to a decision by mid January that they were going to replace them. The told us for our trouble that they would give us 5% off that was the best they could do. My girlfriend and I picked out new piece of furniture which they were out of told us it would be in sometime in March. Then they told us that they wanted the couches back to resell which I had said no
Problem I just need furniture now for my family to sit somewhere on. After 3 days they came back told us we could hang on to the couches till the new ones arrive. Fast forward to this week I get a call Monday the new couches are in. I told them great could you deliver them Saturday. They said yes. Then today the day before they are suppose to deliver the new couches they tell us oh we lost one of the pieces to your couch do you still want us to bring it over missing it. I replied no. So now it will be another two weeks till that piece comes in and my girlfriend and I get our new couch. I can’t believe the service especially of a local company that is suppose to look out for Alaskans!!!!",0,Bailey's Furniture,113411433857611691751,1583563589185.0,1.0,0.809,positive

Just moved to AK and needed an advance just to cover day to day living until things were settled.

Went in and requested an advance, informed the woman that I did not get paid until 2 days after the due date she said that was fine. I also asked if there was an extension option if needed (I'm shipping my truck across country and didn't know when it was coming in, she said yeah you can pay the interest amount and extend it 2 weeks. So she confirmed that on Friday we could call and extend if we needed to. On Friday I woke up to a check that had been submitted to our account from them prior to any funds posting and as such the check was rejected. I called to extend and was informed that I would have to wait until the rejection was finalized. Called on Saturday  and was informed of the same thing, I called Sunday and was informed that my account had been sent to COLLECTIONS! I was told that it is no longer with Cash America Pawn and I would have to deal with the agency now.

I am extremely upset that despite trying to stay in good standing and being reassured of the steps that I was going to take that they would screw me over like this. Now I have a collection agency debt on my credit that should not be there in the first place. Ridiculous!

There aren't a ton of options, but all of them seem to be done well, and there are equivalents of both margarita and  pepperoni pizzas. They ate genuinely wood fired, with the characteristic charring.

The dough is soft with crisped edges and a yeasty flavor, but this is a northern Italian style pizza crust, so expect a thick edge and a soft, thin center. This is not deep dish, not a firm doughy risen crust, and not a crispy thin crust. It's a hand tossed crust with premium toppings.

The flavors vary from familiar to adventurous, but nothing that seems aggressively strong in any respect.

Ordering is done at the counter with delivery to tables with a great view of Seward and the harbor. They support tabs and handle large groups well.

The Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center (AWCC) is an amazing location with improvements to the area every year.  You can see how the management wants to make this location large enough for the animals, but also enjoyable for the public.

If you want to see the bears then arrive around feeding time.  Bring a camera with a long lens, because not all animals are right next to the fence.

Drive slowly for not only safety reasons, but to minimize the amount of dust you'll lift into the air.  People and cars share much of the same area here.

The gift shop has a huge selection of gifts, so take a look.

positive,0x56ccd9dc7e4b7ddf:0xac13d4e7db45700d,Lucy Williams,"Today we had a once in a lifetime adventure (twice) our day started off perfectly with a greeting from our shuttle driver “Iowa” who said he didn’t drive “Badgers” and the bantering began, all In fun of course we did have him outnumbered four to one.

When we arrived at our destinations Temsco Aviation for our helicopter excursion to site see land and walk on a Glacier. Iowa checked us in and gave  us glacier boots and preformed our safety briefing, but only following our official weigh in.

Our “first” trip was a very informative ride with Pablo, he took us out on a narrated ride out to the glacier fields and back to base only to be told we could not land due to weather constraints. A bit disappointed we went back inside to remove our boots and to our surprise we were offered a refund or the opportunity to re-schedule.

We chose the latter and returned later in the day. After the weather cleared we were once again led to our helicopter were this time we meet a real “ rock star” Rachel. She was absolutely amazing from the get go, always smiling and willing to share her knowledge of Alaska and her adventures that landed her with her dream job of flying folks like us to see this absolutely breathtaking place she calls her office.

After twenty minutes of stunning beauty, Rachel picked out the perfect spot to land, and our once in a lifetime journey began. stepping out of a helicopter onto glacier ice is something I will never forget. Ice as deep as 1500 feet below our feet, glacier rock deposits and areas of endlessly deep sink holes left us  “almost” speechless. Rachel offered, and took photos of our group, then we finished exploring this  breathtaking piece of heaven on earth at the foot of Mount  Deborah. Rachel then treated us to a drink from a glacier stream possibly over a hundred years in the making.

Would I go back?  Absolutely!!  I would recommend Temsco Aviation without the slightest hesitation. every person we encountered from the shuttle drivers, ground personnel, to the pilots were all simply fantastic, smiles on their faces, willing to share their stories and  experiences. You can tell how much they loved their jobs and sharing this part of Alaska with us. Anyone who is even considering taking a helicopter glacier tour from Denali, forget the rest, take the best, Temsco Tours and if you’re  really lucky your pilot will have  a very big smile on her face and her name tag will say Rachel.

Second our room smelled like a wet dog and there was dog hairs all over the carpet. In addition, our first night there I killed a coach roach that came out from under our bed. The toilet was loose at the bottom where it’s anchored to the floor but, it was concerning because when you sat down it moved. Of course we reported all of this to the front desk when we checked out. I would not recommend staying at this place. And, for the price of this room, it’s disappointing to pay this much for a mediocre facility! 😡

While at Mayo I asked if I should return every 6 months or so for a follow up assessment. They said that was not needed if I was a patient of Dr. Glass. I have been completely satisfied thoroughly with my care at Peak Neurology. Dr Glass is a very patient listener and communicator.

Having worked around the construction business for 42 years you get great exposure to various levels of craftsmanship and pride, and a “window” into the people behind the work. At Neighbors Windows & Doors (NW&D) I’ve found a courteous, knowledgeable, and highly skilled staff. My standards are very high and at NW&D I find no less. It’s as if their doing an installation in their own homes. Within the first 2 years my heating bill average reduction was 17%. THAT’S HUGE. And you know how sliding patio doors can sometimes drag in their tracks during the winter from iceing? Not true with my new slider. The new windows lowered the summer temps on the wooden floors so much our dogs no longer “sunbathed” in front of the large picture window. Recently NW&D corrected a poorly installed frameless shower door which leaked in our newly remodeled bathroom (another competitor). For the first time in 12 months when this project began am I able to finally enjoy, leak free, our shower. What was I even thinking?

It did not feel right when I was charged $55 at first only to tell me that my car was not ready for the Smog because it looks like someone worked on my car recently and disconnected the battery. The last car maintennance I had and the last people who touched my Honda car were last month with the Honda Dealership itself, so I asked them about it and they said they did not even touch nor disconnected anything. Then, the guy at the front desk told me to drive my car 40 more miles and go back to them with $20 to get the certificate. I came back and was asked if I drove 40 miles and I said more than that because I work every day and drive about a total of 40 minutes each day to work and back. Then, they said my car was still not ready and asked if they could just drive my car around so I let them. The guy who drove my car came back and said it's finally ready but he only drove 2 miles. Seriously?? That's already a total of more than 50 miles total this week since they asked me to drive 40. I was charged about $28 with a total of $83 to pass my car for Smog. It looks and feels like people in the business are taking advantage of this COVID situation. They were NOT even wearing a mask when they are supposed to, NO sign stating everyone must be 6 ft apart, NO sanitizers, NO other signs that the Corona Virus, per state, policies are being enforced, and the chairs inside where the customers sit are next to each other without space. I would hate to have this business closed down for not enforcing health protocols, so Im not coming back to this place instead and write a review to give a heads up to those citizens who care about the situation.

The decor was unique and not typical of most Asian restaurants, the menu had so many varieties of sushi and Specialty rolls and the food was delicious. What they are lacking is good service. I ordered a dinner which came with soup and salad. My friends got their order long before I got mine and when mine finally arrived it was Sushi not my soup and salad which I had to ask for. I also had to ask for Wasabi and gari (ginger) which always comes with sushi. They burned my specialty roll so I had to wait even longer to get that and because of that they gave us a very lovely free dessert for which I thank them. They also gave one of my friends a free glass of plum wine. That was good management. While the wait staff is very pleasant, they did not do their jobs well at all. I left a 10% tip as did my friends. It's really a shame as this could have easily become one of my favorite sushi restaurants.",0,Katsunori Sushi Restaurant,106179418044764454484,1533532837091.0,3.0,0.9914,positive

While this place is somewhat Americanized, it still has that Brazilian charm, with friendly service and delicious food, especially the cooked pineapple sprinkled with cinnamon! The fried bananas, selection of cheeses at the salad bar, and the bacon-wrapped chicken are also favorites. Oh and you have to try the Brazilian cheesebread and Guarana! But be sure to save room for the passion fruit mousse - so packed with flavor it's best to share.

First the agent who showed us the house didn't even give us a tour of the house, he just opened the front door and waited outside and showed no interest in the fact that we loved the house. After applying for the house we found that even their office workers were lazy and impossible to get any response from for information, except for ""I'll check"" and ""We will get back to you tomorrow"" which they never did get back to us. After being told for a week that all they had to do was a previous landlord reference I called our past landlord and asked if they had received any calls or messages and they told us they had not. I called and confronted the lady in the office and she told me that she had been trying to call and when I told her I had talked to my past landlord she started stuttering and backtracking her story and while ""umm"" and ""uhh"" became her new favorite words she said once again ""I'll check on it and get back to you tomorrow.""

I stopped by Torrance H mart with my husband yesterday
Some Jujeon Beak and Orange Juice...
I was thirsty, so I drank orange juice right away
My husband drank a little and gave me our daughter in the back seat
(For reference, my daughter is 34 months old and I am in the hospital)
The moment the child put his mouth on to drink, I saw something strange in my eyes.
It was strange that I took it away so I couldn't eat it. When I checked it, I found that mold was growing at the entrance to drink. I called the mart because I was so embarrassed that there is no manager and I will return the juice so I ask you to come ㅎㅎㅎ Does this make sense in common sense??
I left my phone number but no contact came. I will be apologized for doing everything I can from next Monday.
I think it's really wrong to respond to customers like this at a small mart in the United States. Customers are not Hogu.

저는 LA K- town 살고있습니다
어제 남편과 함께 토랜스 h mart 에 들려
주전부리몇게와 오렌지주스 등..
저는 목이 말랐던 터라 오렌지주스를 바로 마셨고
남편은 조금마시고 뒷자리에 있던 저희 딸을 줬습니다
(참고로 저희딸은34개월이고 저는 입신중입니다)
아이가 마시려고 입을대는 순간 제눈에 이상한것이 보였습니다
이상해서 일단 못먹게 뺏어서 확인해보니 마시는 입구에 곰팡이가 핀것을 확인했고 너무 황당해서 마트에 전화를 했더니 메니저는 없고 주스값 돌려줄테니까 오라고 하네요 ㅎㅎㅎ 이게 상식적으로 말이 됩니까??
전화번호 남겼놨는데도 불구하고 연락은 오지 않았습니다 저는 돌아오는 월요일부터 제가 할수 있는 모든것을 해서라고 사과를 받을것 입니다
미국에서 작지 않은 마트에서 이런식으로 손님응대 하는것은 정말 잘못됐다고 생각합니다 손님이 호구는 아닙니다",0,H Mart Torrance,110586380064471731217,1602957820285.0,1.0,-0.4442,negative

Our home warranty company, First American Life, hired Poe's plumbing to fix our hot water heater in Santa Cruz, CA.  Not too long after they fixed it, we smelled gas.  Poe's came back out and said everything looked fine.

We had to call in PG&E who told us that when Poe's plumbing installed a new controller, they didn't tighten it down.  That's right -- 2 visits to our house, tepid or cold showers for too long, and a nerve-wracking scent of gas in our garage, and then the simplest step skipped and overlooked upon re-inspection....yikes! Very glad they didn't blow our house up.

My recommendation? use a different plumber.  Sorry I don't remember the name of the person who did our work, so at the very least I could advise you ""don't let (this person) do the work.""",0,Poe’s Plumbing & Backflow,111697137688235515411,1604352336051.0,1.0,0.306,positive

I never felt rushed. She took care of me. Then there is Courtney my hygienist. Most of the times most hygienists will talk to you while your mouth is stuffed; unable to respond. And they expect you to reply or have a full conversation with them…Really! It has never made any sense to me. But Courtney is not like that.

They're generally friendly but also generally not around for assistance either.

I went up to Yosemite on a college budget and needed a place within an easy drive of Yosemite, and the Miner's Inn fit the bill perfectly. The reviews were good but the room was even better. The fridge and microwave were invaluable, since I was trying to avoid eating in the in-park restaurants, and stopping by the grocery store nearby made for easy meals. The free breakfast was GREAT and much appreciated. The room was clean and generously sized for a hotel of this price level. The furnishings were maybe a little outdated but who’s complaining?

The location was also great, an easy hour from the central parking lot of the Yosemite Village/Ahwahnee area in the national park. The hotel is right on the major road that takes you into the park, and also conveniently across the street from a gas station (you burn a lot of gas in Yosemite).

The staff was knowledgeable about the park and the Mariposa area. I also have to thank them for helping me jump-start my car when my battery died one morning.

The one negative was the very spotty wifi, but that seemed to be a problem everywhere in the area. And who really goes to Yosemite to use the internet anyway?

I would definitely stay at the Miner’s Inn again and would recommend it to anyone.",0,Yosemite Miners Inn Motel,104137304707047247382,1447771502876.0,5.0,0.9939,positive

I've only been here for two weeks, and I'm having too much fun. There is always something exciting to do.  Each building has an exterior lounge area with a view of the marina, and this is perfect for relaxing and entertaining. There are also resident events like Karaoke, Wine nights, and Doggie Days during the month. My favorite thing to do is to go to the gym. The gym is on three levels; the first level is the weight floor, the second floor is cardio equipment, and the third level host weekly fitness classes like HITT, yoga, body conditioning, boot camp, and spin.

I have no regrets with signing a lease at AMLI except I wish I scheduled a tour sooner than later in my search for a new place. Moving is stressful. The staff here is the best, and they make sure you have the best experience. I toured the property with leasing office representative, Rhoshana. I'm grateful I met her because she is actively engaged in the AMLI activities. It's nice to see a familiar face when you are new. She is always at the resident events and in the gym.

I'm happy to call AMLI Marina Del Rey, my home! I would recommend this property to my friends, family, or anyone else who is considering relocation.",0,AMLI Marina Del Rey,112074634827902014384,1561587804829.0,5.0,0.9952,positive

However the male vet I assume the owner was absolutely awful and completely disrespectful. We had brought our older dog in and saw Dr. Chaudhary who made us feel comfortable and helped us look at options for our dog as we knew it was coming to an end. Once we knew she couldn’t walk anymore and was in so much pain we decided to put her down, not something we came to lightly as are pets our are family. We made the appointment and to our surprise we had the male vet (again I believe is the owner). He didn’t introduce himself and very business like told us the procedure. We had our son with us as we had discussed this in length with him the process and he was there just over a year ago when our other dog had a tumor coming out of his body and we had to put him down. That process went as well as can be expected when you lose a family member. Once the vet came back in he said nothing and jammed the sedative into our dog. She yelped, our son rightfully so screamed and hid. My husband and I were in shock no compassion as well. This traumatized all of us. As our son was hiding the vet proceeded to tell us our “son was too young to see this and he needed to leave”. We did not let our son leave we calmed him down and went through this loss as a family. This was a hard experience to begin with and we did not need to be traumatized by this. The doctor came back shortly with the papers to show us the difference between prices and than came back and gave her the last IV to put her down. Not once did he introduce himself, or tell us he was sorry for our loss. This was such a horrible experience I would never go back unless I knew he was not there and if he’s the owner I would never go back at all. He had no compassion for us as a family or even to our dog. Not only do we have to grieve as a family but we also have to move through this unnecessary traumatic event!

My hair's fine texture has confounded many a stylist and resulted in wispy and unmanageable cuts elsewhere, but Anthony knows exactly how to shape my hair so it looks great from the day of the cut all the way until next time I have an appointment, even if I schedule it late! I've been ecstatic with the results since the very first time he cut my hair a few years ago. He's a master, and a surprisingly rare find in a city like SF.

He just recently moved to Salon Yuni, a bright, modern and welcoming salon just off Fillmore in Pacific Heights.

The salon is lovely and comfortabl, with tons of natural light streaming in from skylights. The place is surrounded by cute boutiques and great restaurants and within walking distance of Japantown, so it's easy to plan a saturday around getting an amazing new haircut at Salon Yuni, even if you don't live in the neighborhood. Everyone who works there is friendly and accommodating and the prices of services and products were quite reasonable for a high-end place like Salon Yuni.",0,bubble pop electric salon,113113000474282339000,1302547546875.0,5.0,0.9962,positive

There are a few good shops in the area but The Exotic Body still stands out from the rest thanks to level of experience & profesionalism the staff have.

The owner can come across as a bit no-nonsense at times which I think can be off-putting to some people, but from my perspective it's really a good thing. The staff are all positive people with a good sense of humor, they just have a preference for responsible nonsense. Which is what you want from someone who's about to stab a needle through part of your body.

It's clear that the owner, and all the staff, not only love what they do but take it seriously. They understand that the art forms they practice create a permanent change to their clients bodies & come with risks, and because they understand this they make sure that everything's done right.

The place is always clean, they have ideal sterilization practices, they teach you about aftercare, they advocate the use of safe jewlery materials & design, and they help their customers to make informed decisions and  get through the piercing process as easily & painlessly as possible.

It is a little more expensive than other shops in the area, but not by a lot. In my opinion it's worth it for the quality & sense of security you get by going to such a top notch place. I trust the staff here and have always had positive experiences with them.

I've had piercings done here by both Samantha & Mike. Sam did my tongue piercing and my helix piercing & Mike did both of my genital piercings. They both did a fantastic job and (obviously) made a repeat customer out of me. I'll be going back here when it's time for my next piercing, and I recommend that anyone else who's looking to get a piercing choose The Exotic Body as well.",0,The Exotic Body,114390823204269662778,1569394993824.0,5.0,0.9967,positive

Went yesterday for a quick bite and drink with friend and I couldn't wait to get out of there. Sadly the menu has changed and not nearly as exciting as the menu was before. Certainly not what you'd expect at a Hyatt. It was busy, that's a good thing, but they done nothing to help accoustically and the noise was so loud it was impossible to talk. Very pleasant server took our order for snack, after 20 minutes of waiting, we made our way through the crowd and told the servers we just wanted our check for our drinks and to leave. If you are 20something and enjoy very crowded, small, loud places and don't mind waiting forever for your food, go for it, but I wouldn't it to anyone and we won't go back. recommend it to anyone.

Half of the menu wasn't available, and the wait despite not being busy had my hopes up for something really special (after all, it was a $17 sandwich).  40 mins later waiting in their dining area and my buzzer still hasn't gone off - their excuse was they called out the order instead.
The sandwich was okay.  Much smaller than I had hoped, and not much better than fast food.  :(",0,The Larder at LAX,113282352632876326753,1522463473381.0,1.0,0.6867,positive

They put jalapenos in the cheese didn't even state in the menu that it comes with jalapenos. They gave us horchata that was really old and it tasted and smelled disgusting. For the price I expect they offer home made tortilla like other restaurants with authentic good quality Mexican food.

After Sam Lewis lied to get her sale- by promising an 8AM pick up - the movers told her they were never told- it’s in writing She missed work and lost a couch and now an additional 1000$ Sam’s boss Jackie Miller laughed at our 3 day debacle ... basically was like oh well... yep you got scammed ... deal with it- I wish zero stars were an option,0,American Movers Inc,104369286312253268388,1577733793050.0,1.0,0.6808,positive

They had a great selection of drinks and that I guess would entice people to come and have a drink. The place was almost packed and I observed that other than us, all the other tables occupied were Caucasians. From my visitation to Japanese restaurants in America, if it was serving great Japanese food, you will see loads of Japanese/Asian people dining but Mamanoko was not the case.

The food was overall very salty and I would think it serves the palette of the patrons in this area of the restaurant. This is my very own objective review of the food I had, so you can make your own judgment when thinking of coming here.  We had the Tokyo Ramen, chicken yakitori, Sea Bento Box, and Umami Sliders. We had the house hot sake too and was sour.",0,Mamanoko,114135503176919776974,1578258596435.0,1.0,0.7717,positive

NONE of the postal workers ever actually deliver packages to your home. They instead drive around in their little car too lazy to get out and hand out pink ""Sorry we missed you slips"" to your mailbox. No knocking, no walking the ten feet it will take to place any package or letter on the front step - Just a slip and the incredibly inconvenient business hours for you to pick it up (Noon to 5pm Monday through Saturday -because screw anyone that has a job and these lazy a-holes can't be expected to work more than five hours.)  Want it redelivered? HA! We've tried that FIVE TIMES ! They were all returned to sender, even after scheduling a re-delivery the day after we received the slip.
Plus they have already lost two of our packages despite the fact that tracking has them last known at their location.
I periodically have to take time off work just to get a package that could easily fit into my mailbox (no signature required) and lose money because they refuse to do their jobs.
The post office location is filled with incompetence - they also have little remorse for you and your missed packages (missed birthday presents, medicine, work related items, time-sensitive materials - they don't care). Worst part is, they don't have to actually do their jobs or care about anything because they are a government job and bad customer reviews don't affect them (I mean just look at how many one stars they have on Google and Yelp).
Finally, don't waste your time trying to call them, they never pick up and their answering machine is always full.
Just poor excuse for a postal service and poor excuse for workers.",0,United States Postal Service,105938951365122965544,1479255628868.0,1.0,-0.9509,negative

I like fresh crab steamed and when the king crab legs came, it had seasoning all over it, including the butter! I asked for plain hot butter, and got it not fully hot. It started hardening. WHITE rice is not white rice. Lol. It looked like brown rice with some veggies in it. 😳 we had the known shrimp with veggies mix, although seasoning IS slightly different too, it was still good. The bread was the only thing that was still really good. I love freshly steamed seafood, but because I didn’t like their butter, I had the crab legs by itself and it was not as fresh tasting which could mean it’s frozen seafood. Will have to go close to the sea to get fresh seafood. Would I go back? Yes, for the shrimp mix and to try the sandwiches? I know change is good, but there are some things best left alone, like HOT, melted, plain butter and plain white rice!

Wednesday evening, around 8:30pm, two of us came here for a late dinner. We were seated immediately and given fantastic service. We ordered two different seasonal drinks, both of which hit the spot. We shared the butternut squash pizza - the squash was perfectly cooked, not too soggy, not raw. The goat cheese was creamy, the pine nuts crunchy, and the crust was soft but still crisp enough on the bottom to hold up.

The order took a while to complete but my number came up. Normally I wouldn't bother to check my order but as it was quite large my husband and I checked through it at the nearest table. Instead of total six sides I had five, and instead of 16 pieces of chicken I had only 8!!!!!  I took my receipt and complaint to the counter. To my surprise no one asked to check my order, there was no apology from the staff, no one took the person who packed my order aside and asked them what happened. It was as though no one was surprized that I was complaining. What would have happened had I not checked the order and had driven the 15 minutes home and then come back???  An assistant did pack me 8 pieces of chicken, these were perhaps the smallest pieces she could find.
Unfortunately there aren't any other KFC nearby. I shall not be a frequent customer to this location in Culver Drive and I suggest that any customer who does go there checks their order to see that they are not being short changed as the stores lack of concern makes me think this is common practise at this restaurant.",0,KFC,102595923903636634535,1408339629923.0,2.0,-0.9517,negative

Swung there immediately for Dinner. Pretty spacious restaurant. Nepalese and Largely Indian cuisine. We tried Samosa as appetizer and Chai Tea. Tea was served in a soup bowl styled cup and tasted good. Samosa was OK-ish.
We ordered :
Garlic naans- Bigger than regular size, good right?
Began Barta- looks like dal fry, rarely tasted like began barta.
Chicken Tikka Masala- Like sweetened tikka masala. Nah!
Chicken Biryani- Close to cooker style pulav, chicken was good though.

As we walked in tables were full and the ones that were empty were dirty! She told us to sit wherever knowing there was literally no tables open. I understand they were busy but she didn't even try and clean any off for us. My husband and I were both standing there looking for a table and just went back to the front to wait. Then, a couple in their 40's came in and stood behind us. The same waitress greeted them and immediately started cleaning off a table for them! Since I saw she was cleaning off the table I proceeded to sit myself . Little did I know she was cleaning off the table for that couple and that couple only that came in AFTER us ! She even told the man ""I can sit you right here"" , which I didn't hear in the moment. My husband saw while I was sitting at the table that she kept staring at me and making faces because I guess I wasn't supposed to sit there?? We had gotten there first , no one tried to clean a table off for us and we felt very unacknowledged!

Walther is straight up, honest and kept us updated on everything. Special call out to Fernando as he was exceedingly dedicated and was ensuring everything is done perfectly.

positive,unknown,Gulsum Akar,We went to Marmaris with my wife for a holiday. We chose this restaurant as a place for dinner based on the reviews and because we wanted juicy food. When we first went there was a serious queue. You proceed by taking the food you want in the form of an open buffet. Both vegetable dishes and meat dishes were plentiful. There was also dessert for those who wanted it. After you get what you want you pay at the cashier. They don't go through cards they work in cash. There was a lot of food variety. And the food prices were unbelievably cheap. We paid only 84 TL for all the meals here. It included buttermilk and bread.

Apparently major world made a replacement remote wit the remote start button on it but the car did not have the package installed.

The food quality almost made up for this except the prices were a little much. One thing to consider would be maybe adding more vegan/vegetarian dishes to the mains. Currently you don’t have any choice but to order multiple overpriced appetizers to be full.

First of all I got a brand new 2019 Infiniti Q50 Luxe, In new york it is illegal to sell a car without a bracket because according to the state of law a New York car has to have a front plate. I called this trash dealership and told them that my car came with no bracket and then they told me I had to purchase one.. How much? $60 mind you I got a car from them now they are telling me to get a bracket? Is it my fault that the car had no bracket? Both the lady and the mechanic are super nasty.. Getting a bracket $60 then $30 for labor work.. Is this a joke? They are super nasty all they want is money. I am so glad that I did not get the bracket from them and another Infiniti dealership supplied it to me for FREE and also installed it for me for FREE. Do not go here for service also do not go here to lease or buy a car. They will rip you off with a smile on their face. They tried to rip me off with $2,000 down and $500 a month for a car. Go to Jersey do not go to this trash dealership they are so nasty and tell you it’s impossible to have a $360 car payment with $1500 out of pocket. This dealership is such a joke I hope it goes out of business.",0,Kings INFINITI,102881211935035055726,1547782365853.0,1.0,0.7149,positive

Our salesman was Mike Tyson (yes, that's his real name) and we couldn't have asked for a better, more personal guy to work with. He made sure we not only got the best deal but the best vehicle for what we need. He went out of his way to list out all our options and to get to know us. The floor manager (Zach Smith) was also amazing. He made sure we we're happy and even stayed late at work to make sure we we're all set. We love our new truck. It feels luxurious but also functional for our house projects. This is the second great experience we had at Hoselton and will no doubt be going back in the future for our car buying needs.",0,Hoselton Chevrolet,103532967721334795865,1525652496417.0,5.0,0.9899,positive

I am currently at Hummus Market, for probably the 10th time in the past 8 weeks ;)!
After 6 years in NY, I only find Hummus Market now. Finally a place where I can enjoy the delights of Mediterranean Foods. They use very fresh ingredients, everything is made fresh to order. Each day I am looking forward to the next time I’ll have lunch there. I’ll be very sad to go back to work after my maternity leave for that reason!! (And to leave my baby of course! Don’t get me wrong;))
I really can’t stand to go to fancy and overrated  places anymore where the food is so average!! Hummus Market is now in my top 3 restaurants in NYC/Brooklyn. Simple, delicious, fair prices, refined, perfectly cooked. The roasted eggplant are so soft/melting in your mouth. Rice Majadra is to die for. And so is the lentil soup!! So mouthwatering just by writing my review !!
Nice backyard in the shade.
If you are a foodie, go there and be adventurous! Don’t go for typical things, try what you don’t find in other Mediterranean restaurant. That’s my opinion of course, you do whatever you want;)

The food is absolutely amazing and with such a wonderful variety of lebanese food you will certainly find something you enjoy.  My first visit was a little under a week ago our order consisted of the mixed sampler (Cheese, olives, Hummus ,Labneh ,Baba Ghannouj, Lebanese bread) 2 meat pies, 1 zaatar pie
(Zaatar, olive oil, instant yeast, flour) and one spinach pie.
Now the sampler has large portions and can easilly be a meal for two with leftovers as well. The meat pies are smaller maybe about 5 inches around but very tasty, the spinach pie was absolutely delicious however it is a smaller portion BUT i would just suggest buying 2!  The zaatar pie is massive (the size of a medium to large pizza) and filling and even with no meat its a MUST TRY, I say this because it was so good that i tried to order one on Monday....unfortunately this amazing restaurant was closed.  They had me hooked with my first bite!  I was so upset that i refused to order from a different restaurant and cooked my own food at home. Today being that yesterday didn't work out for me I immediately came home and called to place an order, I HAD TO TRY MORE ITEMS and get another Zaatar pie!  This round we tried the chicken shawarma plate, and the beef shawarma plate (there was a buy one get one free deal, which i couldn't pass up!) We also tried their baklava!  WOW the photos say it all.  This is no ordinary Lebanese Restaurant, this place is indeed a gem!  The flavor of their food is unique and makes you want more, the quality of their food is exceptional and to top that off the quantity of the food you receive is massive there is absolutely no skimping on the portions and their prices are on point, they are certainly not expensive for what you receive.  1 entre can easilly feed 2 people!  The pie prices are ideal!  Brenda (who owns the business) and her staff are very personable and super friendly...one amazing thing i must note is that they pay attention to food allergies when people inform them and they take all the precautions to make sure there is no cross contamination.  This restaurant may be my new favorite place!  Also before wrapping up this review I'd like to note that the interior is very very clean and certainly maintained.  There are a few tables for indoor dining which is a plus and the atmosphere makes you feel warm inside.  I really cant stress how impressed I am with Teta Marie's and if you have not gone yet, please call and place an order you will not be disappointed.

I was only in town for a couple of hours and decided to include the visit based on Trip Advisor reviews, and am I glad that I did!

Firstly, the location is only a 5-minute ride from the Croton-Harmon station, and via taxi, costs $7 (each way), which is well worth it for the quality of the food.

I hadn't realized that the restaurant wouldn't be open for dinner until 5pm, nevertheless, I was accommodated (quite pleasantly) when I turned up about 10 minutes to the hour.

I explained to my server that I was in a rush, and she quickly took my order and my meals came out in a very timely manner.

I have dined at many Indian restaurants, and I can say that their Chicken Korma is hands down the best I've ever had. Not to mention that they made regular butter Naan taste extraordinary.

The staff was also very attentive - at one point, I was being assaulted by sun rays (I sat by the window) and a member of staff came over, without my asking, and offered to lower the shade, which more than helped.

All in all, it was a wonderful experience, and I'll visit again if ever I am in the area.",0,Raga,117253163361580047809,1505919930351.0,5.0,0.9272,positive

I know because I went to most of them before coming here. Their dedication, patience is unmatched and I’m not just saying that. My previous schools were all scams I’m not naming names. They were not patient and scheduled all my lessons far apart and the communication was dreadful.

However, the team here were so kind and PATIENT it’s not just a job to them. I would definitely recommend AD Driving especially if you’re anxious driver such as myself.

At first, I wanted to trade my scat pack but they did not know how to price it correctly and could not make the numbers work. To their defense, I was looking to trade my Dodge Charger SRT that had a higher value than any brand new Subaru so this was a bit of an unusual trade for them and understandably so. I decided to get rid of my car on my own and returned two months later to deal a straight up lease.

The second time I left due to not being able to beat a competitor's price. It turned out the competitor did not have the exact options I wanted and I decided to return and negotiate a bit more. They ended up meeting me in the middle and I think it was fair.

Overall, the dealership is friendly, and informative. Paul did an excellent job at helping me make an informed decision. We test drive three different cars and closed on an outback that made most sense for me.

Huge positive here! There are no bait and switch tactics, no games, and no wasted time! They truly conduct themselves in a professional matter and the tough bargain was fair but not outrageous (I.e. Being offered a price that is initially inflated by thousands of dollars to drive a long bargain).

It wasn’t until i asked to speak with a manager 17 minutes after arriving at the store that she decided to help me. By the way, I didn’t get to speak with the manager either. I doubt she even paged him. Then she was blaming a girl saying she was new when in fact the ‘new’ girl was the one trying to provide excellent customer service.

Call Laundry Services has been picking up, washing, folding, and delivering 50-70 pounds of my boutique spa’s laundry weekly since September 2019. They truly stand behind “One call cleans it all.” L.A.S.T. Call picks up my laundry every Saturday around 5pm once my work week is over to ensure that all of my soiled sheets, wash cloths and towels are accounted for and ready for drop off Tuesday at 3pm before my work week starts. Each time my laundry is dropped off at my boutique spa it is always fresh, folded neatly and smelling amazing. The scent is never overpowering but it truly lasts a long time. I love how L.A.S.T. Call puts my laundry in sterile plastic bags before placing in the actual laundry bags to ensure no contamination from the spoiled laundry that was previously in it before. L.A.S.T. Call is truly a Heaven sent because I was in need of a new wash and fold service for my company. In order for me to run my business I need to have clean laundry to service my heavy client load. I spent years of washing pounds of laundry and I simply don’t have the time to dedicate it. Without L.A.S.T. Call my business cannot run smoothly. Laundry is no longer a stress for me, I trust L.A.S.T. Call and I am so glad to be a client of theirs. They have even washed my personal laundry for me when I didn’t have time to do it.

All things considered, Virgil's was better than I anticipated. Given the location, I expected a crowded, overpriced, touristy spot. All those are true, BUT the food exceeded my expectations.

Nachos were pretty good. Nothing worse than nachos with liquidy nacho cheese, so melted cheese was enjoyable.

Got the pick 2 combo to split with someone. Pulled chicken, Memphis spare ribs, collard greens, cheesy grits. Loved the ribs. Liked the chicken. I know there's better BBQ in NYC but I entered with tempered expectations and left satisfied.

Service was weak though. Took a LONG time to get drinks, and tracking down our server became an unfortunate theme. I'd go 2.5 stars if I could, but 3 it is.",0,Virgil's Real BBQ - Times Square,102268104607117029790,1596718549283.0,3.0,0.9816,positive

I strongly refer Brooklyn Mitsubishi to anyone who is looking for a good car. Whatever you see in the front isn't only that. They have more cars at the other lots.

The BUILDING as we called it and the good old basketball court rounded out the concrete section and 3 baseball diamonds were added to complete a childhood paradise for us.I can remember having to wait in line to get on the swings on those warm summer nights singing the newest Beatles songs at the top of our lungs. Entering high school a few years later JH was my hangout with my crew where we would go shoot hoops and check out the local girls.My summers would begin with breakfast then a stroll to the H at 9 am to shoot around at the court as my friends would start filing in short thereafter. Ah then noon it was free lunches where we waited for the younger kids to grab theres and we  grabbed the leftovers.A walk to the corner store for an ice cold GLASS BOTTLE of Pepsi and some PENNY CANDY, home for dinner and a clean shirt then off to my second home to play a little more baseball or basketball till the sun set. As we got a little older on a chosen night we would have a few beers  after dark BUT we kept it down and had garbage barrels for our UNBROKEN BOTTLES .We actually took pride in keeping our hangout clean. Then homeward bound or one of our tents or garages for a sleep out nearly every summer night and our parents had no major reason to worry.Those were different times.Innocent times, fun times and memorable times.I wouldnt trade them in for anything.What ever happened to MY WORLD..Oh how I miss it",0,JFK Playground,103724553851103357738,1525873863365.0,5.0,0.9552,positive

The elevators were hard to figure out at 1st.  The room very small and out dated for a Sheraton. Bathroom was super small and no place to hang a hand towel. Shower on the dirty side. Toilet appeared clean on the inside but dirty on the outside. Dirt marks all over the bathroom and closet doors and looked like they had layers of paint over them.  TV big and nice. Beds ok with plenty of pillows. Location a little far from the action for my 8 year old to walk.  A little disappointed for a Sheraton.  Pricy for what we got for a room.,0,Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel,117218117282637329718,1535806960189.0,3.0,-0.0411,neutral

The movers showed up on time and took 15 boxes from my apartment including other items. My partner and I saw them label 15 boxes as they were taking the boxes downstairs. I even signed a contract showing exactly 15 boxes were taken from my apartment. Upon delivery, I only received 14 back. I sent an email to their claims manager. Not only was he curt, he actually refused to acknowledge that the contract stated 15 boxes. He said the movers made a mistake to write 15 boxes there, when they only took 14 boxes to the camera of the truck and blamed me for the inconsistency and their mover’s mistake. They then asked me to make a police report to claim what is lost. Please avoid. The disrespect is not worth it. To make a long story short – they will tear, steal and lose your stuff at your own expense. You will have nothing but rudeness and disrespect in addition to the stress.

Contacted corporate to complain and they left it to the CVS location to contact me... which they never did. Multiple times I've gone in to pick up a script which was supposedly filled, just to be told excuses like: It's out of stock, it'll be ready later today, or there isn't anything for me to pick up. Ask another staff member and you'll get a different answer. One of the cashiers tried giving me the wrong script and actually argued with another cashier who was simply trying to correct him.

Overall the location was great for the ball drop but the streets were blocked off and even though I was only 150 feet from the corner where I could have seen the ball drop on new year's Eve I couldn't see it. I would give it a 5 star but the lock on the door keeps giving us issues and my key takes about 30 attempts before it finally decides to let me in. They came and looked at it which was a maintenance guy who just saw if it light up and decided that it works. Dude! Change the battery.... They get low and still light up but don't have enough power to open the lock. The other thing that stops this place from having a total 5 star rating because they do deserve it is that I have to show my key every time I had to re-enter the hotel. This is not unusual for many hotels in the area but seriously if I stay a week in the same location you would think that the few people there who work the elevators to make sure you have a key would recognize you and not ask every time. I even made it a point to come directly from the elevator, make eye contact with the person, walk up and talk to them and then 6 minutes later come back by and they still didn't recognize me and make me look for the key again. I know it is there his but can't we just put the key reader on the elevator to check so we can go along our way and not stop in the flow of traffic to dig a key out. But overall, this place is very good and I will stay again and I do recommend it.

I was totally left there, ignored and in severe pain with migraine for over 4 hours. There's more, but it just happened  this past week, and don't want to give it a red flag.

Ended up being in surgery once getting to my room, I mean immediately, no time to think. I could not get my meds on time, they didn't care if I was hurting, couldn't walk, I just annoyed them as did my ""roommate.""  The nurses were rude, broken english, nervous and come to find out, most were only there for 1-2 months. Umm, not good, and without supervision.

Once I was released, I realized I was NOT given instructions on how to care for my post-op stuff. They sent me home with paperwork, but ZERO instructions. Most doctors are ""hospitalists,"" so you cannot reach one.

I tried calling this morning, and they only take calls (at the followup clinic) if you are going to make a follow-up appointment OR pay your bill!

My own primary card doctor just left the area, suddenly, and now I am left hanging with a Nor'easter on the way. I could go into sepsis, and do not know what to do.

I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN! Such a shame, we'll see if they even get $10.00 a month to pay my bill.

An utter DISGRACE to the region, it's integrity of the medical profession, and their patients. It's not the first time I had a problem, last time I had had chest pain (years ago) and was considered a cardiac patient. They took blood work, walked away, never came back, no monitoring, came back 8 hours later, told me to see my cardiologist.

They ran out of guacamole and said deal with it dude. I went their on many occasions specifically 7:00 - 8:00 and ended up waiting 45 - 70 minutes each time for a burrito. I came back in hope they have improved these issues and they have not so I now go to Funcho’s on Main Street which has the same food quality with better service. The seating is also very limited which is a struggle if you are there for a sit down meal. The worst part is almost every time I go there they get the order wrong.

Our server was the finest of servers we've had since moving to this area. But its a mismatch for the restaurant that she works in. We ordered 1 alcupuria, 1 papa rellena, the rabo (oxtail) and the arroz con pollo. The alcupuria tasted as if the root vegetable they used was not ripe or was used before it was ready. The side guisado sauce was too watery. The papa rellena was just ok. The oxtail was a major let down. Between it being made in a heavy tomato base verses a natural brown gravy the onions were uncooked. On the positive the white rice was good and so were the frijoles colorados. But the arroz con pollo was terrible. Frozen corn, string beans and diced carrots have no business being in the authentic classic dish. White chicken chunks were used in place of chicken meat on the bone which gives the dish so much more moisture and flavor. It was drowning in sweet peas as well. No pimento as a garnish to finish the classic. Avocado on either side was added but shouldn't have for the sake of those who have food allergies. I ordered a piece of cuero (pig skin cracklin') that comes off the pork shoulder which is supposed to be flavored with garlic and spices and is supposed to be to many a desired portion, a highlight-- a treat of a pernil dish. It was put in the friolator and delivered horribly burnt! How the chef put that out is unexplainable. My personal opinion when it comes to the type of items you place on your menu is that you should make it as authentic as the classic recipe. If you are a fusion or nouveau style restaurant let it be known in your name and your branding. I take great offense when a restaurant puts a twist on an authentic meal most specifically Hispanic food because you lose the authenticity in the translation of the dish. Additionally, pick a country and stick with it. Meaning if you want to sell Cuban sandwiches your menu should be all Cuban. Mixing the menu up to include Mexican tacos with Puerto Rican alcupurias and Colombian bandejas is reaching way to far. Stick to the classic recipes from one country and become an expert then you will not fail. The restaurant also needs a vestibule to control all the cold air that comes in from the doors.Hopefully they will change a few things around. Otherwise, I'm sorry but I don't see this restaurant sticking around for too long.

My problem is that I was told that my alternator was the problem and was what was gonna keep killing my battery. My warranty company wouldn't allow my alternator to be changed because this Midas only offers a 90 day warranty on their alternators (which can't be helped) so i went to Jeep to get an extended warranty on it. When I got there, they had to run their own diagnosis and it came back saying nothing was wrong with my alternator. Could've saved $170...

Edit: I just got a call from Midas and am very satisfied with the customer service. Although the diagnostic fee was from Jeep, I was offered mechanic services up to $220 for my troubles which is more than generous.

I was suppose to stay 3 nights but ended up leaving after one night. Just a horrible experience. Literally felt scared for my life the whole night and the door only had one lock which shouldn’t even couldn’t as a lock to tell you the truth. And there was a crack head outside the premises were you park your car for 3 hrs straight walking around the parking lot and in the front of the building,0,Bay Shore Inn,unknown,1569715200000.0,-999.0,-0.8861,negative

Overall the sandwiches are very good. But you have to ask yourself is any bagel worth almost a two-hour wait. All ingredients seem very tasty, and you may think it's worth it. The best way to go about this it's just order your sandwich online and pick it up that will save you the trouble. There is no table service here so keep that in mind when you come here. My biggest disappointments of the restaurant was that any hot sandwich is heated in the microwave. We were ready to have the Lox, and eggs and when we saw the ace being being in a tray and put into a microwave oh, that was a complete turn-off and opted for a cold sandwich. Yes, the bagels are amazing. I think probably one of the best that I've had in New York. You can see them being baked right in front of you once you're inside the deli. If you do not want to wait for a long time, just walk right in and buy your bagels only and take him home and do as you wish. When I come back? Yes, but only if I order ahead online I would not get in line again for a sandwich.",0,Ess-a-Bagel,102021913081586175868,1544821590600.0,4.0,0.9917,positive

Drive through team was prompt and courteous and still had patience after the half hour onslaught of over-heated, hungry and rushing workforce lunch-breakers and kids on summer break. And I'm sure that what I witnessed was just the tail end of it. If this were a review of the customers, subtract 4 stars. But, the food was hot and fries fresh and soft but not soggy. I asked for honey mustard and amazingly it was in the bag. So, for service and product as expected, I feel 5 stars is most appropriate. It is more often then not that I walk away with something to gripe about. Daily incidentals can drag down a mood and raise stress levels; It's wonderful when they're positive and uplifting but I'm always happy to settle for neutral. For the decent, forgettable experience I long for when buying lunch, this now tops my list. Thanks to the Wendy's employees.",0,Wendy's,103488312142718696286,1561406307961.0,5.0,0.9823,positive

I really don't like banks that are not customer friendly, not towards the customer but more towards the protection of their money. I don't like calling customer service who can't answer my questions and keep passing you from one rep to another because they are higher up and MIGHT be able to answer my question. This is covid times here, scams are running wild. Chase is suppose to protect the customer, not by taking a pending check from another bank and clearing it, then reversing it 3 days later, wiping out their customers account. You are suppose to either keep it in pending so the customer doesn't take it or at very very least,  tell the customer this doesn't officially clear for 3 to 4 days. A few simple words go a long way.

They were taken over by Extra Space and didn’t inform anyone as to official rule changes. I had my packages delivered there from the previous company and all my packages were returned at my expense without warning —- and yet somehow the blame was put on me that I should have miraculously known the new policy even though no one communicated it.

The new manager Jeff is perhaps the worlds worst communicator and was not just hostile, entitled and insulting, but had a lack of accountability for any wrong doing and continued to blame me for not being psychic and knowing random new rules.

Somehow if I had been psychic, and known of a policy change and it’s timing - regardless of not being informed, this wouldn’t have happened??!!

They’re the only persons who get my order right lol... I’d give them 10+ stars if I could especially with their fried rice. They certainly satisfy my cravings for West Indian foooood,0,Bigwell,115073984003040035141,1562886897312.0,5.0,0.9805,positive

CRM picks and chooses what they feel like doing. They pride themselves on custom care but only pick who they will help or not.  It seems very clear that if not all these reviews are from the friends and business partners and not actual customers as I know firsthand how they tend to a customer. They are completely unprofessional, rude and do not listen to the needs of the actual homeowners and try to interpret the bylaws as they see fit even when faced with facts. They tend to deflect responsibility when the issue is tough. This is not a good sign of leadership. They try and play the game that they take pride in customer care and provide a service, but this is not the truth. When they don’t like what they hear even if its facts, they will cut you off on responding or downplay and deflect. They will deflect and say they are given directives by a Board to which they follow, however the bylaws are the management documents that must be followed!

If you are a homeowner for a property they manage, I would excise your right in a civil manner to asked them about the health of your community, financials, and any other important information as a stakeholder of your property to insure they are doing the right thing. I’m sure they will try to downplay this rating and your concerns!

Edit/update: There response is typical and proves what I have stated above in there deflecting of what they don't like to hear or can't handle.",1,"CRM Management Services, LLC",107315051138495743990,1622298738641.0,1.0,0.9704,positive
