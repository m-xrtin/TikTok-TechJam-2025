It took over 40 minutes to receive the order and then our company couldn't even eat it and had to take it in a to go container as the service took far to long. We sat and watched others that had been seated after us get their orders before we even got our appetizer. 1 star because there wasn't an option for 0.",

It took about 45 minutes to get in checked-in as the night staff person had no clue what she was doing and it was clear she didn't have much training. She had to call her boss 3 times to get help checking us in. I had paid online before hand, but was charged a second time. I was told I was was swiping my card for accidentals, but instead was charged the full amount again. After a long day of traveling, the whole experience was very frustrating.\nWe stayed another night, booking it before our first experience, at the end of our trip and although check-in was smoother, a housekeeping staff member walked right into our room just after I had gotten out the shower. No knocking to check if there was anyone there.\nThe room itself was okay, but the walls are paper thin and you can here everything. Overall, this place lacks management and training and I'd advise spending the money to stay some where else.",

Then Dr. Tuers came in, asked me some questions, recommended a sleep study and blood work, and that was it. He was nice, no issues at all. Went to the front desk and paid. They told me I could come in whenever for my blood work.\n\nShowed up about a week later and was seen within 10 minutes for bloodwork with a couple people ahead of me. I still havent done the sleep study, but that's laziness on my part. They have followed up to check on me about it.\n\nAll in all not a single issue. The appointment was easy and pleasant.",

We were in the process of building our cabin in the summer of 2016 when one of our Boxers, who was 11 years old, became bloated and got \"twisted gut\". It was absolutely heart breaking. We brought her in to this vet office and they were so nice, caring, and sympathetic. We did end up having to put her down but they told us we could spend as much time as we needed in the room with her before we had to do it and never once rushed us or told us we had to do this now. When the time came, they made plaster paw prints for our kids. These are amazing people and I commend them for the job they do. Great place, great people. Thank you to the caring staff.",

Mike emphasized his mission to gain customers for life rather than a one stop shop experience. My truck got rammed while it was parked so I had some minor dents on the back end of it. Mike wanted to see if he can take out the dents even before I made the commitment to work with them, free of charge. I knew I found the shop I wanted to work with, the work they did on my truck is amazing! You wouldn't be able to tell it was damaged by looking at it. If you ever need work done on your vehicle I would highly recommend Mirage Auto Painting & Collision! You will not regret your decision.",

    "text": "The only problem I had with this specific joann's is that it was pretty dirty and we could not for the life of us find an employee on the floor that could help us find what we were looking for. Sense the registers are behind a wall and the only way to exit the register area is to walk out or back through the line asking a cashier anything is just about impossible.\n\nOther than that they had way better variety of crafts than the joanns out in wasilla. We also found diamond painting kits which have been impossible to find in stores and the variety of what they had was amazing. They were a bit more expensive than ones you can find online but I'm willing to pay the extra price because shopping for them online can be a gamble.",

Clean hotel. Our suite was huge and well maintained. In room coffee, hair blowdryer, refrigerator, and microwave provided. Plenty of towels in bathroom. Comfortable bed. Washers and dryers availble for use ($2.00 ea per load). Free breakfast offers both hot and cold items. Good coffee. Try the \"bold\" blend. There is a bar/restaurant on site that serves dinner. We did not eat there, but the menu seemed to have a decent variety of appetizers and entrees. Overall, a nice place to stay.",

    "text": "Terrible management. I made reservation months in advance. We were on our way to the hotel from Talkeetna on August 17th 2019 and should have arrived at 5PM. We encounter a forest fire and the ONLY road to Anchorage was closed and were told road will be closed indefinitley. I called the hotel to cancel our reservation and explain our unforseen circumstances. The gal on phone was rude and told me the hotel requires 24 hour notice and can not cancel. I asked to speak to the manager. The gal took my cell phone number and would have the manager call us back.\nNo one called us back. I called back and manager was still not available....REALLY.\nWe sat in the road block for over 5 hours. The road opened around 1100PM and arrived to hotel around 1:30AM and encountered another rude employee. By time we settled in and fell asleep 2:30AM and woke up at 9:15 Am and ran down the hall to get coffee or something to eat for we had not eaten due to being stuck on the highway.\nThe door to serving area was closed. I knocked and opened the door and saw about 5 employees sitting on the counters eating the food. We were told there was no more food or coffee and closed the door on me. RUDE!\nRoom- leaking shower that allowed water to leak into the bedroom and forcing us to  walk on the wet carpet. GROSS!\nCouch was dirty with crusty stains.\nI responded to a survey for hotel conveying my experience and Management's repsonse was \"Thank you for the valuable feedback. We have shared your response with the appropriate hotel team.\" WHAT!\nThis past weekend we stayed at HILTON for 3 days. When checking out, we were asked if there were any issue with our stay. I said just things out of the hotel's control with children running around in room above ours until after midnight 2 nights. They were so apologetic and insistent of crediting our account with 2000 Hilton points.\nTHAT IS HOW MANAGEMENT HANDLES ISSUES MARRIOTT!\nToday management has written a response that have made several attempts to call me. I have never recieved a call from said management!",

First of all- again, the salmon cuts are out of shape and not at the same weight, and second- half of the salmon vacuum packs were not vacuumed properly- it wasn’t vacuumed all around the edges of salmon piece, but rather having all air inside. I’m questioning now the quality of those pieces during the shipping. I think that after paying so much money, one would hope their perishable item will be handled with care.\nAlso, just a side note, there is nothing wrong with it- but I wish scallops were packed in a smaller pre-packs. Now once it’s opened, it will need to be eaten at once. And there quite a lot of them in one pack.\n\nAnd one more upsetting moment- once we place a large order, you always sent to us a coupon for discount, knowing that the customer already made a purchase. It’s like laughing at their faces! Vitacost used to do it, we are no longer their customer! Instead of taking care of your valuable customers, you just laugh at their faces... and you might say you gave us discount at the first place, but let’s be honest- first you raise the prices and then you sent a discount code to everyone. It’s been a pattern for some time. Do you really think that’s how you should treat your returning customers?",

When we bought the tires during change over season they said for me to leave them there over night and they would mount and balance the tires to our winter rims and we could come in and get them put on our truck the next day. I left our rims and old tires with them and after the new tires (which we got a discount/special on) got put on the next day I noticed that the wheel covers were missing and was told that they were not on the rims when we brought them in when in fact they were. When the tires were put on the tire monitor system was not hooked up or reset so the notification is always displayed. We have not had a chance to head back to Midas to have them check it out.\n\nOther than the issue with our winter rims and tire sensors, this is a good, quick place to get your oil changed and they usually have a special or coupon that can be used too.",

We stopped while we were christmas shopping and they said they could not get us in, which i understand on a holiday saturday afternoon.\nSo i really wanted to try them because the atmosphere just seemed so much nicer and relaxing than the other places ive been to in fairbanks.\nStopped at 2pm on a thursday afternoon in march to get a pedicure. The shop had 5 people getting manicures and no one that i could see back in the pedicure chairs. The receptionist said it would be a 45 minute wait. So i made an appt for 45 minutes from then and said i would be back. Went and killed time in town.\nCame back in 40 minutes and the receptionist said to have a seat. I waited for 30 more minutes and then went and told them it wasnt worth it to wait any longer and left.\nNot worth the wait!",

I brought my daughter in on a Thursday trying to figure out what the schedule was because their website does not work on mobile devices. They told me that they were not that technologically advanced enough to be able to use mobile phone websites. So I got a paper schedule from them showing their on Saturday they are open from noon to 1:30 for public scate. So I brought my daughter in at noon on Saturday. she has been excited all week to go ice skating and I find out the schedule that they gave me and the one an a huge board at the rink is not what they're going by. They are only going by the hockey schedule and they have hockey all day which they planned out on Wednesday somehow even though they were closed Wednesday. I understand that the majority of the money they make comes from hockey but thats still no excuse for the way they operate. If you're gonna go to this rink for open skate call ahead and do not trust the schedule or what they tell you.",

So we were excited to give it a try, however we proceeded with apprehensive, cautionary anxiety because of most of the customer service reputation around town, especially in food service.\n\nHands down, this place first met and exceeded expectations and we keep coming back because they are respectful to their customers, and fulfill orders the way you ordered. Like that's there job right? But again, in Juneau this was a pleasant surprise. Great tasting pizza, prices beat mostly every other pizza joint in down, and the quality is great. Keep it up Papa Johns, we want you to stick around for a very long while.",

And I have asked some dumb questions, I'm sure. I also like how the Trek store will service any bike, not just their own brand. And getting service done is so affordable! Anyway, a post-service survey asked me how likely I am to recommend Trek Bicycle store to a friend, and my real answer is that I already have. You guys are awesome. Keep it up!",

Basically they offer overpriced excursions that will be better at other ports along the route. Our 7 day cruise had 4 port days. Icy Strait Point was our first port and we had a FULL day there. The \"port\" has nothing to do if you don't book an excursion outside of a 20 minute walking path through some admittedly pretty forest. They offer a Zip line that is better suited for a theme park. Other ports along the way have zip line tours over a few hours. This is a zip line that last seconds.\n\nAfter over 8 hours in Icy Strait Point we got 4 hours in Alaska's capitol city of Juneau.\n\nIn short icy Strait Point is a cash grab by the cruise line on their captive audience. There is a reason you can't find this place on a map.",

    "text": "First off I never do this but to be honest I have never been treated this bad by a store. In September of 2019 my girlfriend and I purchased a couch a love seat and recliner which was not a cheap purchase mind you. Right off the get go there was something was wrong with couch which they did to there credit come out right away to fix it. Fast forward to the beginning of December I noticed tears on the love seat and recliner. They came out took pictures telling us it was a manufacturer’s defect that they would probably have to get is a new couch. which after telling me it going through insurance my girlfriend and I purchased then two weeks later it going through store which took forever. Meaning they came to a decision by mid January that they were going to replace them. The told us for our trouble that they would give us 5% off that was the best they could do. My girlfriend and I picked out new piece of furniture which they were out of told us it would be in sometime in March. Then they told us that they wanted the couches back to resell which I had said no\nProblem I just need furniture now for my family to sit somewhere on. After 3 days they came back told us we could hang on to the couches till the new ones arrive. Fast forward to this week I get a call Monday the new couches are in. I told them great could you deliver them Saturday. They said yes. Then today the day before they are suppose to deliver the new couches they tell us oh we lost one of the pieces to your couch do you still want us to bring it over missing it. I replied no. So now it will be another two weeks till that piece comes in and my girlfriend and I get our new couch. I can’t believe the service especially of a local company that is suppose to look out for Alaskans!!!!",

I also asked if there was an extension option if needed (I'm shipping my truck across country and didn't know when it was coming in, she said yeah you can pay the interest amount and extend it 2 weeks. So she confirmed that on Friday we could call and extend if we needed to. On Friday I woke up to a check that had been submitted to our account from them prior to any funds posting and as such the check was rejected. I called to extend and was informed that I would have to wait until the rejection was finalized. Called on Saturday  and was informed of the same thing, I called Sunday and was informed that my account had been sent to COLLECTIONS! I was told that it is no longer with Cash America Pawn and I would have to deal with the agency now.\n\nI am extremely upset that despite trying to stay in good standing and being reassured of the steps that I was going to take that they would screw me over like this.

But seriously... you're here for pizza and beer.\n\nThere aren't a ton of options, but all of them seem to be done well, and there are equivalents of both margarita and  pepperoni pizzas. They ate genuinely wood fired, with the characteristic charring.\n\nThe dough is soft with crisped edges and a yeasty flavor, but this is a northern Italian style pizza crust, so expect a thick edge and a soft, thin center. This is not deep dish, not a firm doughy risen crust, and not a crispy thin crust. It's a hand tossed crust with premium toppings.\n\nThe flavors vary from familiar to adventurous, but nothing that seems aggressively strong in any respect.\n\nOrdering is done at the counter with delivery to tables with a great view of Seward and the harbor. They support tabs and handle large groups well. Service was pretty prompt and while there wasn't an abundance of tables, it seemed to be enough to handle the seasonal crowd.",

    "text": "When you want to see many Alaskan animals in one place.\n\nThe Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center (AWCC) is an amazing location with improvements to the area every year.  You can see how the management wants to make this location large enough for the animals, but also enjoyable for the public.\n\nIf you want to see the bears then arrive around feeding time.  Bring a camera with a long lens, because not all animals are right next to the fence.\n\nDrive slowly for not only safety reasons, but to minimize the amount of dust you'll lift into the air.  People and cars share much of the same area here.\n\nThe gift shop has a huge selection of gifts, so take a look.\n\nIf this review was helpful please click the Like button.",

    "text": "Today we had a once in a lifetime adventure (twice) our day started off perfectly with a greeting from our shuttle driver “Iowa” who said he didn’t drive “Badgers” and the bantering began, all In fun of course we did have him outnumbered four to one.\n\nWhen we arrived at our destinations Temsco Aviation for our helicopter excursion to site see land and walk on a Glacier. Iowa checked us in and gave  us glacier boots and preformed our safety briefing, but only following our official weigh in.\n\nOur “first” trip was a very informative ride with Pablo, he took us out on a narrated ride out to the glacier fields and back to base only to be told we could not land due to weather constraints. A bit disappointed we went back inside to remove our boots and to our surprise we were offered a refund or the opportunity to re-schedule.\n\nWe chose the latter and returned later in the day. After the weather cleared we were once again led to our helicopter were this time we meet a real “ rock star” Rachel. She was absolutely amazing from the get go, always smiling and willing to share her knowledge of Alaska and her adventures that landed her with her dream job of flying folks like us to see this absolutely breathtaking place she calls her office.\n\nAfter twenty minutes of stunning beauty, Rachel picked out the perfect spot to land, and our once in a lifetime journey began. stepping out of a helicopter onto glacier ice is something I will never forget. Ice as deep as 1500 feet below our feet, glacier rock deposits and areas of endlessly deep sink holes left us  “almost” speechless. Rachel offered, and took photos of our group, then we finished exploring this  breathtaking piece of heaven on earth at the foot of Mount  Deborah. Rachel then treated us to a drink from a glacier stream possibly over a hundred years in the making.\n\nWould I go back?  Absolutely!!  I would recommend Temsco Aviation without the slightest hesitation. every person we encountered from the shuttle drivers, ground personnel, to the pilots were all simply fantastic, smiles on their faces, willing to share their stories and  experiences. You can tell how much they loved their jobs and sharing this part of Alaska with us. Anyone who is even considering taking a helicopter glacier tour from Denali, forget the rest, take the best, Temsco Tours and if you’re  really lucky your pilot will have  a very big smile on her face and her name tag will say Rachel.\n\nSent from my iPad",

Second our room smelled like a wet dog and there was dog hairs all over the carpet. In addition, our first night there I killed a coach roach that came out from under our bed. The toilet was loose at the bottom where it’s anchored to the floor but, it was concerning because when you sat down it moved. Of course we reported all of this to the front desk when we checked out. I would not recommend staying at this place. And, for the price of this room, it’s disappointing to pay this much for a mediocre facility! 😡\nDisappointed in Anchorage,  Room 1025.The Lewis’s",

They said that was not needed if I was a patient of Dr. Glass. I have been completely satisfied thoroughly with my care at Peak Neurology. Dr Glass is a very patient listener and communicator. He not only is a skilled in the practice of medicine; he is skilled at the art of medicine. The staff of Peake Neurology is also very patient oriented and are polite and always very helpful.",

Our tour guide recommended this place for lunch so we came here.\n\nOverall really great experience in this really cute cafe. We ordered the Fish \"witch\", Sand Dollar Dilla, and a cup of latte. The food was really good and the fish was fresh. Portions are great too so definitely come here if you're hungry!\n\nIn terms of the store, there is a boutique gift shop when you go in, they have a lot of handmade, petite gifts that make perfect souvenirs. Upstairs seating is closed off because of Covid but there are plenty of seating on the ground floor (see photos) for you to enjoy your meal indoors. There are also heaters by the tables so you'll be cozy and warm!",

As a manager for many hears in high end customer service, I have very high expectations, and In My Element did not disappoint!!!  I came in looking for a very specific dress for my upcoming casual wedding. I was greeted by each of the ladies working in the store as I looked through the racks. They asked if I had anything specific in mind, and in fact found exactly what I was looking for even though it wasn’t currently on a rack.  I was extremely happy with the dress I bought.  All of the ladies were extremely friendly, helpful, and treated me with professionalism while at the same time making me feel like a close friend!  I highly recommend In My Element if you are looking for super cute clothes, shoes,  and accessories, with an amazing staff in a relaxed professional environment!!",

Dr. Bradstreet was equal unprofessional...the 2 stars are... 1 for Berry and 1 for Paul who where both great at their job.\nI would advise if you want more professional health care go elsewhere.

Captain Mike is extremely knowledgeable and knows how to put you on fish. The staff, captain Mike, and the kids cleaning the fish are all very accomadating and know what they're doing. All in all, sitka point lodge is great place to experience alaska and guide you on that dream fishing excursion you've always wanted to take",

Having worked around the construction business for 42 years you get great exposure to various levels of craftsmanship and pride, and a “window” into the people behind the work. At Neighbors Windows & Doors (NW&D) I’ve found a courteous, knowledgeable, and highly skilled staff. My standards are very high and at NW&D I find no less. It’s as if their doing an installation in their own homes. Within the first 2 years my heating bill average reduction was 17%. THAT’S HUGE. And you know how sliding patio doors can sometimes drag in their tracks during the winter from iceing? Not true with my new slider. The new windows lowered the summer temps on the wooden floors so much our dogs no longer “sunbathed” in front of the large picture window. Recently NW&D corrected a poorly installed frameless shower door which leaked in our newly remodeled bathroom (another competitor). For the first time in 12 months when this project began am I able to finally enjoy, leak free, our shower. What was I even thinking? Thank you Steve & Dana & your ENTIRE STAFF for jobs well done and for continuing to operate at the highest levels of pride and craftsmanship. It speaks volumes to where your values lie with your customer base.",

Nice parenting, teaching your children to take people for a ride, then laugh in their faces. Never stay here!",

    "text": "They tried to find ways to charge me more. It did not feel right when I was charged $55 at first only to tell me that my car was not ready for the Smog because it looks like someone worked on my car recently and disconnected the battery. The last car maintennance I had and the last people who touched my Honda car were last month with the Honda Dealership itself, so I asked them about it and they said they did not even touch nor disconnected anything. Then, the guy at the front desk told me to drive my car 40 more miles and go back to them with $20 to get the certificate. I came back and was asked if I drove 40 miles and I said more than that because I work every day and drive about a total of 40 minutes each day to work and back. Then, they said my car was still not ready and asked if they could just drive my car around so I let them. The guy who drove my car came back and said it's finally ready but he only drove 2 miles. Seriously?? That's already a total of more than 50 miles total this week since they asked me to drive 40. I was charged about $28 with a total of $83 to pass my car for Smog. It looks and feels like people in the business are taking advantage of this COVID situation. They were NOT even wearing a mask when they are supposed to, NO sign stating everyone must be 6 ft apart, NO sanitizers, NO other signs that the Corona Virus, per state, policies are being enforced, and the chairs inside where the customers sit are next to each other without space. I would hate to have this business closed down for not enforcing health protocols, so Im not coming back to this place instead and write a review to give a heads up to those citizens who care about the situation. If you don't care, then this review is not for you.",

The decor was unique and not typical of most Asian restaurants, the menu had so many varieties of sushi and Specialty rolls and the food was delicious. What they are lacking is good service. I ordered a dinner which came with soup and salad. My friends got their order long before I got mine and when mine finally arrived it was Sushi not my soup and salad which I had to ask for. I also had to ask for Wasabi and gari (ginger) which always comes with sushi. They burned my specialty roll so I had to wait even longer to get that and because of that they gave us a very lovely free dessert for which I thank them. They also gave one of my friends a free glass of plum wine. That was good management. While the wait staff is very pleasant, they did not do their jobs well at all. I left a 10% tip as did my friends. It's really a shame as this could have easily become one of my favorite sushi restaurants.",

While this place is somewhat Americanized, it still has that Brazilian charm, with friendly service and delicious food, especially the cooked pineapple sprinkled with cinnamon! The fried bananas, selection of cheeses at the salad bar, and the bacon-wrapped chicken are also favorites. Oh and you have to try the Brazilian cheesebread and Guarana! But be sure to save room for the passion fruit mousse - so packed with flavor it's best to share. Our waitress, Josie, was so nice and had excellent timing all night.",

    "text": "SCAMMING CON ARTISTS!!!These people are a real joke when it comes to customer service and work ethics. First the agent who showed us the house didn't even give us a tour of the house, he just opened the front door and waited outside and showed no interest in the fact that we loved the house. After applying for the house we found that even their office workers were lazy and impossible to get any response from for information, except for \"I'll check\" and \"We will get back to you tomorrow\" which they never did get back to us. After being told for a week that all they had to do was a previous landlord reference I called our past landlord and asked if they had received any calls or messages and they told us they had not. I called and confronted the lady in the office and she told me that she had been trying to call and when I told her I had talked to my past landlord she started stuttering and backtracking her story and while \"umm\" and \"uhh\" became her new favorite words she said once again \"I'll check on it and get back to you tomorrow.\" Finally after they screwed up the first contract by forgetting information that was on our application and that we had told them over and over again,we rejected the second contract and decided to go elsewhere.",

When I checked it, I found that mold was growing at the entrance to drink. I called the mart because I was so embarrassed that there is no manager and I will return the juice so I ask you to come ㅎㅎㅎ Does this make sense in common sense??\nI left my phone number but no contact came. I will be apologized for doing everything I can from next Monday.\nI think it's really wrong to respond to customers like this at a small mart in the United States. Customers are not Hogu.\n\n(Original)\n저는 LA K- town 살고있습니다\n어제 남편과 함께 토랜스 h mart 에 들려\n주전부리몇게와 오렌지주스 등..\n저는 목이 말랐던 터라 오렌지주스를 바로 마셨고\n남편은 조금마시고 뒷자리에 있던 저희 딸을 줬습니다\n(참고로 저희딸은34개월이고 저는 입신중입니다)\n아이가 마시려고 입을대는 순간 제눈에 이상한것이 보였습니다\n이상해서 일단 못먹게 뺏어서 확인해보니 마시는 입구에 곰팡이가 핀것을 확인했고 너무 황당해서 마트에 전화를 했더니 메니저는 없고 주스값 돌려줄테니까 오라고 하네요 ㅎㅎㅎ 이게 상식적으로 말이 됩니까??\n전화번호 남겼놨는데도 불구하고 연락은 오지 않았습니다 저는 돌아오는 월요일부터 제가 할수 있는 모든것을 해서라고 사과를 받을것 입니다\n미국에서 작지 않은 마트에서 이런식으로 손님응대 하는것은 정말 잘못됐다고 생각합니다 손님이 호구는 아닙니다",

Not too long after they fixed it, we smelled gas.  Poe's came back out and said everything looked fine.\n\nWe had to call in PG&E who told us that when Poe's plumbing installed a new controller, they didn't tighten it down.  That's right -- 2 visits to our house, tepid or cold showers for too long, and a nerve-wracking scent of gas in our garage, and then the simplest step skipped and overlooked upon re-inspection....yikes! Very glad they didn't blow our house up.\n\nMy recommendation? use a different plumber.  Sorry I don't remember the name of the person who did our work, so at the very least I could advise you \"don't let (this person) do the work.\"",

From the moment I stepped into the building it was a delight. Elizabeth the specialty coordinator, greeted me right away as if I were a member of their family.  Very helpful and very knowledgeable. Elizabeth was so nice. She answered all my questions. I never felt rushed. She took care of me. Then there is Courtney my hygienist. Most of the times most hygienists will talk to you while your mouth is stuffed; unable to respond. And they expect you to reply or have a full conversation with them…Really! It has never made any sense to me. But Courtney is not like that. She will have a conversation but after the fact or if need be when I the patient is able to respond. Plus she was gentle.\n\nOVERALL GREAT EXPERICENCE! GREAT STAFF. VERY CLEAN OFFICE AND HAS THE STATE OF THE ART EQUIPMENT.",

I don't usually see the same employees more than once or twice so I think that there is a high turnover. The staff that work there seem a bit overworked and spread thin. They're generally friendly but also generally not around for assistance either. They sell great balloons and I think they could do even more if they had more helium tanks and another person, especially at graduation time etc. We waited 2 and 1/2 hours for 3 simple Mylar balloons ( not in the store, and we didnt need them In a rush so it was okay-ish, but we had to go back to work and then stop back by on break). The cashier line is slow mainly because they usually only have one. It's a Party City but I dont have another to at this time...however the dollar store is faster for balloons.",

The ingredients are always fresh and of high-quality, and the wait just means you get to watch everything be made right in front of you. I don't know if I can recommend just one item on the menu, because EVERYTHING (from the El Cheapo all the way to Happy Chicken) is just that good. Make sure to get some of the salsa (fresh, slightly spicy pico de gallo that is out of this world) and guacamole too! Actually, just get the super nachos and you will thank me later!",

Everything has always been outstanding. They have perfected combining distinct complimentary flavors, and each dish actually tastes as exciting as the menu description makes it sound. I've never been disappointed with a single thing I've put in my mouth here, and I never leave with buyers remorse. The food and experience are totally worth the price if you want to go out for a nice dinner. Favorites are BBQ butterfly prawns, ahi poke, macadamia crusted mahi mahi with lobster sauce, and the pineapple martini!",

    "text": "This may well be the best budget hotel in the vicinity of Yosemite, or for that matter, one of the best values I've received for a room price anywhere.\n\nI went up to Yosemite on a college budget and needed a place within an easy drive of Yosemite, and the Miner's Inn fit the bill perfectly. The reviews were good but the room was even better. The fridge and microwave were invaluable, since I was trying to avoid eating in the in-park restaurants, and stopping by the grocery store nearby made for easy meals. The free breakfast was GREAT and much appreciated. The room was clean and generously sized for a hotel of this price level. The furnishings were maybe a little outdated but who’s complaining?\n\nThe location was also great, an easy hour from the central parking lot of the Yosemite Village/Ahwahnee area in the national park. The hotel is right on the major road that takes you into the park, and also conveniently across the street from a gas station (you burn a lot of gas in Yosemite).\n\nThe staff was knowledgeable about the park and the Mariposa area. I also have to thank them for helping me jump-start my car when my battery died one morning.\n\nThe one negative was the very spotty wifi, but that seemed to be a problem everywhere in the area. And who really goes to Yosemite to use the internet anyway?\n\nI would definitely stay at the Miner’s Inn again and would recommend it to anyone.",

    "text": "AMLI is the absolute best new location in Marina Del Rey. The high ceiling views and high-end amenities are a dream. I've only been here for two weeks, and I'm having too much fun. There is always something exciting to do.  Each building has an exterior lounge area with a view of the marina, and this is perfect for relaxing and entertaining. There are also resident events like Karaoke, Wine nights, and Doggie Days during the month. My favorite thing to do is to go to the gym. The gym is on three levels; the first level is the weight floor, the second floor is cardio equipment, and the third level host weekly fitness classes like HITT, yoga, body conditioning, boot camp, and spin.\n\nI have no regrets with signing a lease at AMLI except I wish I scheduled a tour sooner than later in my search for a new place. Moving is stressful. The staff here is the best, and they make sure you have the best experience. I toured the property with leasing office representative, Rhoshana. I'm grateful I met her because she is actively engaged in the AMLI activities. It's nice to see a familiar face when you are new. She is always at the resident events and in the gym.\n\nI'm happy to call AMLI Marina Del Rey, my home! I would recommend this property to my friends, family, or anyone else who is considering relocation.",

There's only one bad thing, I notified them of a leakage in one of the women's bathroom and 6 days later the leak was still there. You would think that since there is a shortage of water in California that they would go fix it right away, but that is not the case. Hopefully they will fix it soon so they stop wasting water. All and all, we will definitely consider this park again in our future travels.",

We had brought our older dog in and saw Dr. Chaudhary who made us feel comfortable and helped us look at options for our dog as we knew it was coming to an end. Once we knew she couldn’t walk anymore and was in so much pain we decided to put her down, not something we came to lightly as are pets our are family. We made the appointment and to our surprise we had the male vet (again I believe is the owner). He didn’t introduce himself and very business like told us the procedure. We had our son with us as we had discussed this in length with him the process and he was there just over a year ago when our other dog had a tumor coming out of his body and we had to put him down. That process went as well as can be expected when you lose a family member. Once the vet came back in he said nothing and jammed the sedative into our dog. She yelped, our son rightfully so screamed and hid. My husband and I were in shock no compassion as well. This traumatized all of us. As our son was hiding the vet proceeded to tell us our “son was too young to see this and he needed to leave”. We did not let our son leave we calmed him down and went through this loss as a family. This was a hard experience to begin with and we did not need to be traumatized by this. The doctor came back shortly with the papers to show us the difference between prices and than came back and gave her the last IV to put her down. Not once did he introduce himself, or tell us he was sorry for our loss. This was such a horrible experience I would never go back unless I knew he was not there and if he’s the owner I would never go back at all. He had no compassion for us as a family or even to our dog. Not only do we have to grieve as a family but we also have to move through this unnecessary traumatic event! I will be sharing this experience with the community!",

My hair's fine texture has confounded many a stylist and resulted in wispy and unmanageable cuts elsewhere, but Anthony knows exactly how to shape my hair so it looks great from the day of the cut all the way until next time I have an appointment, even if I schedule it late! I've been ecstatic with the results since the very first time he cut my hair a few years ago. He's a master, and a surprisingly rare find in a city like SF.\n\nHe just recently moved to Salon Yuni, a bright, modern and welcoming salon just off Fillmore in Pacific Heights.\n\nThe salon is lovely and comfortabl, with tons of natural light streaming in from skylights. The place is surrounded by cute boutiques and great restaurants and within walking distance of Japantown, so it's easy to plan a saturday around getting an amazing new haircut at Salon Yuni, even if you don't live in the neighborhood. Everyone who works there is friendly and accommodating and the prices of services and products were quite reasonable for a high-end place like Salon Yuni.",

    "text": "I've gotten 4 out of my 5 piercings here and when friends ask me about where to get a piercing this is always the place I recommend. There are a few good shops in the area but The Exotic Body still stands out from the rest thanks to level of experience & profesionalism the staff have.\n\nThe owner can come across as a bit no-nonsense at times which I think can be off-putting to some people, but from my perspective it's really a good thing. The staff are all positive people with a good sense of humor, they just have a preference for responsible nonsense. Which is what you want from someone who's about to stab a needle through part of your body.\n\nIt's clear that the owner, and all the staff, not only love what they do but take it seriously. They understand that the art forms they practice create a permanent change to their clients bodies & come with risks, and because they understand this they make sure that everything's done right.\n\nThe place is always clean, they have ideal sterilization practices, they teach you about aftercare, they advocate the use of safe jewlery materials & design, and they help their customers to make informed decisions and  get through the piercing process as easily & painlessly as possible.\n\nIt is a little more expensive than other shops in the area, but not by a lot. In my opinion it's worth it for the quality & sense of security you get by going to such a top notch place. I trust the staff here and have always had positive experiences with them.\n\nI've had piercings done here by both Samantha & Mike. Sam did my tongue piercing and my helix piercing & Mike did both of my genital piercings. They both did a fantastic job and (obviously) made a repeat customer out of me. I'll be going back here when it's time for my next piercing, and I recommend that anyone else who's looking to get a piercing choose The Exotic Body as well.",

Went yesterday for a quick bite and drink with friend and I couldn't wait to get out of there. Sadly the menu has changed and not nearly as exciting as the menu was before. Certainly not what you'd expect at a Hyatt. It was busy, that's a good thing, but they done nothing to help accoustically and the noise was so loud it was impossible to talk. Very pleasant server took our order for snack, after 20 minutes of waiting, we made our way through the crowd and told the servers we just wanted our check for our drinks and to leave. If you are 20something and enjoy very crowded, small, loud places and don't mind waiting forever for your food, go for it, but I wouldn't it to anyone and we won't go back. recommend it to anyone. Sadly not much good to say except servers were friendly.",

They gave us horchata that was really old and it tasted and smelled disgusting. For the price I expect they offer home made tortilla like other restaurants with authentic good quality Mexican food. The waitress was clueless in how to attend people she does not know how to speak to customers. Waste of time and money.

    "text": "Came here for Sumo hour after seeing it had 4.6 stars on Google map and had high expectations. The food was sub-par at best. They had a great selection of drinks and that I guess would entice people to come and have a drink. The place was almost packed and I observed that other than us, all the other tables occupied were Caucasians. From my visitation to Japanese restaurants in America, if it was serving great Japanese food, you will see loads of Japanese/Asian people dining but Mamanoko was not the case.\n\nThe food was overall very salty and I would think it serves the palette of the patrons in this area of the restaurant. This is my very own objective review of the food I had, so you can make your own judgment when thinking of coming here.  We had the Tokyo Ramen, chicken yakitori, Sea Bento Box, and Umami Sliders. We had the house hot sake too and was sour.",

    "text": "This has got to be the worst excuse for a postal service I have ever seen. A complete joke. NONE of the postal workers ever actually deliver packages to your home. They instead drive around in their little car too lazy to get out and hand out pink \"Sorry we missed you slips\" to your mailbox. No knocking, no walking the ten feet it will take to place any package or letter on the front step - Just a slip and the incredibly inconvenient business hours for you to pick it up (Noon to 5pm Monday through Saturday -because screw anyone that has a job and these lazy a-holes can't be expected to work more than five hours.)  Want it redelivered? HA! We've tried that FIVE TIMES ! They were all returned to sender, even after scheduling a re-delivery the day after we received the slip.\nPlus they have already lost two of our packages despite the fact that tracking has them last known at their location.\nI periodically have to take time off work just to get a package that could easily fit into my mailbox (no signature required) and lose money because they refuse to do their jobs.\nThe post office location is filled with incompetence - they also have little remorse for you and your missed packages (missed birthday presents, medicine, work related items, time-sensitive materials - they don't care). Worst part is, they don't have to actually do their jobs or care about anything because they are a government job and bad customer reviews don't affect them (I mean just look at how many one stars they have on Google and Yelp).\nFinally, don't waste your time trying to call them, they never pick up and their answering machine is always full.\nJust poor excuse for a postal service and poor excuse for workers.",

I asked for plain hot butter, and got it not fully hot. It started hardening. WHITE rice is not white rice. Lol. It looked like brown rice with some veggies in it. 😳 we had the known shrimp with veggies mix, although seasoning IS slightly different too, it was still good. The bread was the only thing that was still really good. I love freshly steamed seafood, but because I didn’t like their butter, I had the crab legs by itself and it was not as fresh tasting which could mean it’s frozen seafood. Will have to go close to the sea to get fresh seafood. Would I go back? Yes, for the shrimp mix and to try the sandwiches? I know change is good, but there are some things best left alone, like HOT, melted, plain butter and plain white rice! Lol",

I came in about an hour before closing and my stylist just wanted to get me out. After less then ten minutes and using the scissors for maybe one minute, my stylist claimed to be ‘done’. After he claimed to have finished, I had to tell him twice to take more off but he insisted that all I needed was product - which he didn’t even offer. I also asked him to thin out the top, which he did not do. The $23 I spent was not worth the ten minute, careless haircut I received. I’ll have to go someplace else to have my haircut fixed.",

The lobby has a great sitting area with large windows looking over a peaceful, well maintained garden. The staff is very professional and knowledgeable. We stayed in a \"kids suite\", boy what a great idea! The kids had their own room, bunkbeds, and television. The mini fridge and microwave were a big help. The pool was awesome! Nothing fancy, but definitely nice and well maintained, newer outdoor furniture, warm, had plenty of towels available at all times and the best part is that it had two shallow ends! Plenty of room to play for the little ones. The only thing we didn't like was the crowded breakfast area. More staff is needed to keep the place clean and stocked. On another note, there was a good variety of food to choose from. There was always plenty of shaded parking, but you have to pay $10.99 per day so you can park on the property. We've never had to pay to park at a hotel we already paid to stay in.",

Better field than most I been to! Also this is a private owned property they can charge you whatever they want. It’s pay your way in or walk in and not pay anything.

We shared the butternut squash pizza - the squash was perfectly cooked, not too soggy, not raw. The goat cheese was creamy, the pine nuts crunchy, and the crust was soft but still crisp enough on the bottom to hold up.\n\nI'd love to come another time and order some non pizza items!",

The process was very smooth and straight forward, I put in the inquiry, they called me within the hour and my appointment was scheduled, just like that! The best part is I missed my first appointment because I was running late; however Ely was very friendly and was able to see me same day at a later time. I’ve had my car for about a week now and I love it! Shoutout to my man Ely! He was laid back and made the process much more comfortable for me.",

Water to the house turned off, and Sean said he'd come back after we had a cabinet removed, if time permitted. We had the cabinet removed--it took hours. Sean came back late on Sunday, corrected the problem efficiently and we once again had running water! Thanks, Sean 8-13-19 Bad garbage disposal Sean showed up to install a new one Installation was quick seamless and exactly as promised Sean then left, taking the trash with him. Sean is a very competent fellow and a nice person Thanks, again, Sean The above is a review from last year when Sean did some very competent work for us. On Sunday, the 21st, we experienced a leak in a hot water line in the attic and Marcus climbed up into that very warm attic, diagnosed the problem and solved it . If the leak had continued the water would likely have brought part of the ceiling down, but Marcus stopped the leak in no time and we now have all our water available (especially good for showers). I'd recommend Marcus in a heartbeat. Did a great job!!",

The order took a while to complete but my number came up. Normally I wouldn't bother to check my order but as it was quite large my husband and I checked through it at the nearest table. Instead of total six sides I had five, and instead of 16 pieces of chicken I had only 8!!!!!  I took my receipt and complaint to the counter. To my surprise no one asked to check my order, there was no apology from the staff, no one took the person who packed my order aside and asked them what happened. It was as though no one was surprized that I was complaining. What would have happened had I not checked the order and had driven the 15 minutes home and then come back???  An assistant did pack me 8 pieces of chicken, these were perhaps the smallest pieces she could find.\nUnfortunately there aren't any other KFC nearby. I shall not be a frequent customer to this location in Culver Drive and I suggest that any customer who does go there checks their order to see that they are not being short changed as the stores lack of concern makes me think this is common practise at this restaurant.",

Nepalese and Largely Indian cuisine. We tried Samosa as appetizer and Chai Tea. Tea was served in a soup bowl styled cup and tasted good. Samosa was OK-ish.\nWe ordered :\nGarlic naans- Bigger than regular size, good right?\nBegan Barta- looks like dal fry, rarely tasted like began barta.\nChicken Tikka Masala- Like sweetened tikka masala. Nah!\nChicken Biryani- Close to cooker style pulav, chicken was good though.\n\nOverall a 3 star rating for keeping the Indian flavor alive in Santa Rosa and humble service.",

She told us to sit wherever knowing there was literally no tables open. I understand they were busy but she didn't even try and clean any off for us. My husband and I were both standing there looking for a table and just went back to the front to wait. Then, a couple in their 40's came in and stood behind us. The same waitress greeted them and immediately started cleaning off a table for them! Since I saw she was cleaning off the table I proceeded to sit myself . Little did I know she was cleaning off the table for that couple and that couple only that came in AFTER us ! She even told the man \"I can sit you right here\" , which I didn't hear in the moment. My husband saw while I was sitting at the table that she kept staring at me and making faces because I guess I wasn't supposed to sit there?? We had gotten there first , no one tried to clean a table off for us and we felt very unacknowledged! Keep in mind my husband and I are both in our 20's and I too am pregnant but she favored the other couple. We felt misjudged and not welcomed at all. It's unfortunate that we experienced this because we were looking forward to having a new spot to go to. Very disappointed!",

There were about 20-25 people standing in line already. The sweet security lady greeted us and recommended we do the paperwork online on our smartphones to speed up the processing; we all did. The staff made sure we're in the right line, with the appropriate documentation, and inside before they even opened. At 8am, the numbers on the screen started rolling quickly. I was done before 8:30am. Everyone I encountered there was very professional, courteous, and helpful. I'll definitely use this branch in the future when I need the DMV.",

Walther is straight up, honest and kept us updated on everything. Special call out to Fernando as he was exceedingly dedicated and was ensuring everything is done perfectly. Rest of the crew was courteous, skillful and really done great job. The final walk through was perfect and everything was cleaned up when they finished.\nWonderful value for the money we invested.

There was also dessert for those who wanted it. After you get what you want you pay at the cashier. They don't go through cards they work in cash. There was a lot of food variety.

My car was supposed to have gps and remote start. It took 2.5 months to get the GPS installed after getting thr run around for months. Now I'm here trying to get the remote starter installed. I took my car to the Chrysler dealership and they said the car doesnt even have remote start capabilities installed. Apparently major world made a replacement remote wit the remote start button on it but the car did not have the package installed. Been here 4.5hours already and they say they need minimum 1 more hour. Im sooooo through with this place. I'll never deal with them again!! There's no reason 5 months after purchase in still dealing with crap from this place!",

One thing to consider would be maybe adding more vegan/vegetarian dishes to the mains. Currently you don’t have any choice but to order multiple overpriced appetizers to be full.\n\nAmbience was amazing and the design of the restaurant is beautiful.",

First of all I got a brand new 2019 Infiniti Q50 Luxe, In new york it is illegal to sell a car without a bracket because according to the state of law a New York car has to have a front plate. I called this trash dealership and told them that my car came with no bracket and then they told me I had to purchase one.. How much? $60 mind you I got a car from them now they are telling me to get a bracket? Is it my fault that the car had no bracket? Both the lady and the mechanic are super nasty.. Getting a bracket $60 then $30 for labor work.. Is this a joke? They are super nasty all they want is money. I am so glad that I did not get the bracket from them and another Infiniti dealership supplied it to me for FREE and also installed it for me for FREE. Do not go here for service also do not go here to lease or buy a car. They will rip you off with a smile on their face. They tried to rip me off with $2,000 down and $500 a month for a car. Go to Jersey do not go to this trash dealership they are so nasty and tell you it’s impossible to have a $360 car payment with $1500 out of pocket. This dealership is such a joke I hope it goes out of business.",

We called Harry, and he came right out during the rain to check out the situation. Right away he offered several solutions before we deciding on taking out the whole drive way and re-paving it. Other companies probably won't do this, but Harry offered us the credit we had already paid him and repaved our driveway. And it is beautiful and exactly the way we like. Water will never back into the garage with the new driveway. We highly recommend Precision to anyone who is looking for resurfacing or repaving their driveway!",

Our salesman was Mike Tyson (yes, that's his real name) and we couldn't have asked for a better, more personal guy to work with. He made sure we not only got the best deal but the best vehicle for what we need. He went out of his way to list out all our options and to get to know us. The floor manager (Zach Smith) was also amazing. He made sure we we're happy and even stayed late at work to make sure we we're all set. We love our new truck. It feels luxurious but also functional for our house projects. This is the second great experience we had at Hoselton and will no doubt be going back in the future for our car buying needs.",

We were a little apprehensive about not being able to pick him out in person because puppy picking day didn't work with our schedules (we live in Boston), but our skype session with Beth was nothing short of perfect! She helped us pick out Hux and made sure we were absolutely certain. We picked him up in Syracuse the following weekend and he is the light of our lives! He is so calm and sweet and loving, and I know this is all thanks to the superior breeding of Lakeshore doodles! Highly recommend :).",

I have eaten here for 25 years once a week before the pandemic and order regularly but they laughed, saying I should eat it with my hands. I know  this sounds childish but I miss the old days when restaurants cared about their regular customers. My only advice is to order by phone (not Seamless) and to be specific and also see if you can ask for someone other than Monique. The soups are better than average and they have Peking duck that is not great but quite good.",

Finally a place where I can enjoy the delights of Mediterranean Foods. They use very fresh ingredients, everything is made fresh to order. Each day I am looking forward to the next time I’ll have lunch there. I’ll be very sad to go back to work after my maternity leave for that reason!! (And to leave my baby of course! Don’t get me wrong;))\nI really can’t stand to go to fancy and overrated  places anymore where the food is so average!! Hummus Market is now in my top 3 restaurants in NYC/Brooklyn. Simple, delicious, fair prices, refined, perfectly cooked. The roasted eggplant are so soft/melting in your mouth. Rice Majadra is to die for. And so is the lentil soup!! So mouthwatering just by writing my review !!\nNice backyard in the shade.\nIf you are a foodie, go there and be adventurous! Don’t go for typical things, try what you don’t find in other Mediterranean restaurant. That’s my opinion of course, you do whatever you want;)\nJust enjoy",

Supposed to be on auto servicing for gas and they haven't refilled in 9 months which caused us to lose propane  on a weekend in July with a house full of people .  Could not feed the children that were here.  When I called was put on hold multiple times/ disconnected.  Assured it would be remedied Sunday if I called at exactly 8 am which I did.  I was then told impossible to have someone here until monday.  Hours later received a call that if I was willing to pay $300 they would have someone come \"diagnose\" the problem.  I explained there was nothing to diagnose we were out of gas.  Long story short I will not have gas until the week.  Will be cancelling my services next week.",

    "text": "This quaint gem located on Cohoes Island is certainly worth the visit.  The food is absolutely amazing and with such a wonderful variety of lebanese food you will certainly find something you enjoy.  My first visit was a little under a week ago our order consisted of the mixed sampler (Cheese, olives, Hummus ,Labneh ,Baba Ghannouj, Lebanese bread) 2 meat pies, 1 zaatar pie\n(Zaatar, olive oil, instant yeast, flour) and one spinach pie.\nNow the sampler has large portions and can easilly be a meal for two with leftovers as well. The meat pies are smaller maybe about 5 inches around but very tasty, the spinach pie was absolutely delicious however it is a smaller portion BUT i would just suggest buying 2!  The zaatar pie is massive (the size of a medium to large pizza) and filling and even with no meat its a MUST TRY, I say this because it was so good that i tried to order one on Monday....unfortunately this amazing restaurant was closed.  They had me hooked with my first bite!  I was so upset that i refused to order from a different restaurant and cooked my own food at home. Today being that yesterday didn't work out for me I immediately came home and called to place an order, I HAD TO TRY MORE ITEMS and get another Zaatar pie!  This round we tried the chicken shawarma plate, and the beef shawarma plate (there was a buy one get one free deal, which i couldn't pass up!) We also tried their baklava!  WOW the photos say it all.  This is no ordinary Lebanese Restaurant, this place is indeed a gem!  The flavor of their food is unique and makes you want more, the quality of their food is exceptional and to top that off the quantity of the food you receive is massive there is absolutely no skimping on the portions and their prices are on point, they are certainly not expensive for what you receive.  1 entre can easilly feed 2 people!  The pie prices are ideal!  Brenda (who owns the business) and her staff are very personable and super friendly...one amazing thing i must note is that they pay attention to food allergies when people inform them and they take all the precautions to make sure there is no cross contamination.  This restaurant may be my new favorite place!  Also before wrapping up this review I'd like to note that the interior is very very clean and certainly maintained.  There are a few tables for indoor dining which is a plus and the atmosphere makes you feel warm inside.  I really cant stress how impressed I am with Teta Marie's and if you have not gone yet, please call and place an order you will not be disappointed.  I know I wasn't!",

I waited a few minutes said I would be back in I had a little one in the car. They asked me what car was mine and they would bring it out. I didn't have to wait much longer. The lady apologized said any time it takes longer let them know I have a kid in the car and they will bring it out. She stated their cook didn't show up. When getting home. (Angola.) Food was still hot. We were impressed. We never would of known they were scrambling around due to the cook not showing up. This isn't the first time we ordered from them. We have never have been disappointed with our food. Besides when they changed whatever they use for spinach in the Calzones.",

Not to mention that they made regular butter Naan taste extraordinary.\n\nThe staff was also very attentive - at one point, I was being assaulted by sun rays (I sat by the window) and a member of staff came over, without my asking, and offered to lower the shade, which more than helped.\n\nAll in all, it was a wonderful experience, and I'll visit again if ever I am in the area.",

And you have to be patient because there are great dishes and not so great dishes in every restaurant. They make pretty decent food overall, great location for pick up because you can park right in front of the store, convenient because you can even order with the app. Try a few times to see if you like it.  One caution, the place is not neat, pretty messy and don't look great so you need to get over that.",

Their dedication, patience is unmatched and I’m not just saying that. My previous schools were all scams I’m not naming names. They were not patient and scheduled all my lessons far apart and the communication was dreadful.\n\nHowever, the team here were so kind and PATIENT it’s not just a job to them. I would definitely recommend AD Driving especially if you’re anxious driver such as myself.\n\nWhen I passed my road test I was completely having a melt down prior. But my instructor let’s Nickname them August, reassured me and calmed me down and  of course everything was great in the end. So yeah 10/10",

When it was my turn, I placed my order, paid, and stood to the side while awaiting my order completion. The man who came in after me, got to the register, paid and was immediately handed his order. When I asked how his order was ready so quickly, I  was told that they knew his order. I told them that they should follow the same process with everyone and not skip ahead to preparing someone's order just because they are able to order in their language. Very unfair treatment.",

Each and every time, Paul was extremely pleasant to work with, very attentive, and very professional.\n\nAt first, I wanted to trade my scat pack but they did not know how to price it correctly and could not make the numbers work. To their defense, I was looking to trade my Dodge Charger SRT that had a higher value than any brand new Subaru so this was a bit of an unusual trade for them and understandably so. I decided to get rid of my car on my own and returned two months later to deal a straight up lease.\n\nThe second time I left due to not being able to beat a competitor's price. It turned out the competitor did not have the exact options I wanted and I decided to return and negotiate a bit more. They ended up meeting me in the middle and I think it was fair.\n\nOverall, the dealership is friendly, and informative. Paul did an excellent job at helping me make an informed decision. We test drive three different cars and closed on an outback that made most sense for me.\n\nHuge positive here! There are no bait and switch tactics, no games, and no wasted time! They truly conduct themselves in a professional matter and the tough bargain was fair but not outrageous (I.e. Being offered a price that is initially inflated by thousands of dollars to drive a long bargain). I recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a Subaru and I recommend Paul specifically based on my extremely positive experience.",

It wasn’t until i asked to speak with a manager 17 minutes after arriving at the store that she decided to help me. By the way, I didn’t get to speak with the manager either. I doubt she even paged him. Then she was blaming a girl saying she was new when in fact the ‘new’ girl was the one trying to provide excellent customer service.\nWhat a shame!",

They truly stand behind “One call cleans it all.” L.A.S.T. Call picks up my laundry every Saturday around 5pm once my work week is over to ensure that all of my soiled sheets, wash cloths and towels are accounted for and ready for drop off Tuesday at 3pm before my work week starts. Each time my laundry is dropped off at my boutique spa it is always fresh, folded neatly and smelling amazing. The scent is never overpowering but it truly lasts a long time. I love how L.A.S.T. Call puts my laundry in sterile plastic bags before placing in the actual laundry bags to ensure no contamination from the spoiled laundry that was previously in it before. L.A.S.T. Call is truly a Heaven sent because I was in need of a new wash and fold service for my company. In order for me to run my business I need to have clean laundry to service my heavy client load. I spent years of washing pounds of laundry and I simply don’t have the time to dedicate it. Without L.A.S.T. Call my business cannot run smoothly. Laundry is no longer a stress for me, I trust L.A.S.T. Call and I am so glad to be a client of theirs. They have even washed my personal laundry for me when I didn’t have time to do it. They are beta testing a dry cleaning component of their company with some of my personal formal dresses. I trust L.A.S.T. Call with all of my garments. Recently, I moved my laundry from shelves to storage cabinets ...",

All those are true, BUT the food exceeded my expectations.\n\nNachos were pretty good. Nothing worse than nachos with liquidy nacho cheese, so melted cheese was enjoyable.\n\nGot the pick 2 combo to split with someone. Pulled chicken, Memphis spare ribs, collard greens, cheesy grits. Loved the ribs. Liked the chicken. I know there's better BBQ in NYC but I entered with tempered expectations and left satisfied.\n\nService was weak though. Took a LONG time to get drinks, and tracking down our server became an unfortunate theme. I'd go 2.5 stars if I could, but 3 it is.",

    "text": "I placed an order on June 26th and didn’t finally receive the product until September 21.  The items was a $16 key chain and it was scheduled to arrive in 4-6 weeks.  I called the company 3 times, and was told that I would receive email updates, but to no avail.  When talked to manager last time, I asked about compensation due to waiting 12 weeks rather than the 4-6 as described.  The manager told me there was nothing they could due with payment compensation, so I asked for some other form.  He said he would send some items in the mail.  Today, I received a $1.00 water bottle and a mini bottle opener!  Way to go out of your way 911erp!!! Never again will I order from your company and word will spread through the fire communities.",

The prices are better the other places. I strongly refer Brooklyn Mitsubishi to anyone who is looking for a good car. Whatever you see in the front isn't only that. They have more cars at the other lots. What you need to do is just walk to Brooklyn Mitsubishi on 5910 chucho ac and ask for Joseph Wilner and you will be satisfy.",

The BUILDING as we called it and the good old basketball court rounded out the concrete section and 3 baseball diamonds were added to complete a childhood paradise for us.I can remember having to wait in line to get on the swings on those warm summer nights singing the newest Beatles songs at the top of our lungs. Entering high school a few years later JH was my hangout with my crew where we would go shoot hoops and check out the local girls.My summers would begin with breakfast then a stroll to the H at 9 am to shoot around at the court as my friends would start filing in short thereafter. Ah then noon it was free lunches where we waited for the younger kids to grab theres and we  grabbed the leftovers.A walk to the corner store for an ice cold GLASS BOTTLE of Pepsi and some PENNY CANDY, home for dinner and a clean shirt then off to my second home to play a little more baseball or basketball till the sun set. As we got a little older on a chosen night we would have a few beers  after dark BUT we kept it down and had garbage barrels for our UNBROKEN BOTTLES .We actually took pride in keeping our hangout clean. Then homeward bound or one of our tents or garages for a sleep out nearly every summer night and our parents had no major reason to worry.Those were different times.Innocent times, fun times and memorable times.I wouldnt trade them in for anything.What ever happened to MY WORLD..Oh how I miss it",

The room very small and out dated for a Sheraton. Bathroom was super small and no place to hang a hand towel. Shower on the dirty side. Toilet appeared clean on the inside but dirty on the outside. Dirt marks all over the bathroom and closet doors and looked like they had layers of paint over them.  TV big and nice. Beds ok with plenty of pillows. Location a little far from the action for my 8 year old to walk.  A little disappointed for a Sheraton.  Pricy for what we got for a room.",

The movers showed up on time and took 15 boxes from my apartment including other items. My partner and I saw them label 15 boxes as they were taking the boxes downstairs. I even signed a contract showing exactly 15 boxes were taken from my apartment. Upon delivery, I only received 14 back. I sent an email to their claims manager. Not only was he curt, he actually refused to acknowledge that the contract stated 15 boxes. He said the movers made a mistake to write 15 boxes there, when they only took 14 boxes to the camera of the truck and blamed me for the inconsistency and their mover’s mistake. They then asked me to make a police report to claim what is lost. Please avoid. The disrespect is not worth it. To make a long story short – they will tear, steal and lose your stuff at your own expense. You will have nothing but rudeness and disrespect in addition to the stress. Avoid.",

We originally went the second weekend and couldn't even get close to the entrance because there were so many cars, we have up and left.  We found out later on there was some sort of festival and that's why it was so packed. If you only want to experience the sky ride try to avoid this festival weekend. I don't believe it was mentioned at all on the sky ride website, otherwise we wouldn't have gone that weekend. We returned the 3rd weekend in October and it was an easy process without the festival traffic and crowds.",

We start talking to Skyler he seems like he's going to try to get us down to the price we wanted (we were shooting for around 400 a month for 60 months). After talking to Tony  (i guess one of the owners), seemed like he was really going to give us a great deal. He comes back with \"great news,\" got it \"down\" to our price range for $429 a month for 72 months (not 60, which is 30,888. Mind you it was tagged for 28k ish). AND, after the 72 months we would only owe $9k! So a jeep they had listed for 28k they tried to sell me for $40k. Make sure you do your math before buying.",

Multiple times I've gone in to pick up a script which was supposedly filled, just to be told excuses like: It's out of stock, it'll be ready later today, or there isn't anything for me to pick up. Ask another staff member and you'll get a different answer. One of the cashiers tried giving me the wrong script and actually argued with another cashier who was simply trying to correct him.\n\nUpper management doesn't really seem to care how the place is being run so I'd honestly suggest going elsewhere, at least for prescriptions.",

Overall the location was great for the ball drop but the streets were blocked off and even though I was only 150 feet from the corner where I could have seen the ball drop on new year's Eve I couldn't see it. I would give it a 5 star but the lock on the door keeps giving us issues and my key takes about 30 attempts before it finally decides to let me in. They came and looked at it which was a maintenance guy who just saw if it light up and decided that it works. Dude! Change the battery.... They get low and still light up but don't have enough power to open the lock. The other thing that stops this place from having a total 5 star rating because they do deserve it is that I have to show my key every time I had to re-enter the hotel. This is not unusual for many hotels in the area but seriously if I stay a week in the same location you would think that the few people there who work the elevators to make sure you have a key would recognize you and not ask every time. I even made it a point to come directly from the elevator, make eye contact with the person, walk up and talk to them and then 6 minutes later come back by and they still didn't recognize me and make me look for the key again. I know it is there his but can't we just put the key reader on the elevator to check so we can go along our way and not stop in the flow of traffic to dig a key out. But overall, this place is very good and I will stay again and I do recommend it. The location is great and I love the older rooms because they offer a lot more space and bang for the buck.",

FORD does the oil change and tune up but does not update the state inspection. I paid $1,200 for the tune up and oil change. I return now to get the State inspection. I figure after paying $1200 previously, I would get a complimentary State inspection. In fact, Ahmed gave me the impression that I would get the inspection free, so I left my car to get the inspection only to return to get a bill for $40. I could have gone to a local mechanic shop and paid $25 for the inspection.\n\nThe FORD service center is greedy and practices thievery with customers.   Money at all cost is how they proceed.

Renting in NYC is extremely stressful and difficult and it is hard to find agents of Nicolas's caliber. Throughout the entire process he was polite, understanding, patient and charismatic.  He was empathetic when it came to my budget, location requirements, wish list and concerns.  In the end, he made it happen!  He even came by a few days after I had moved in to personally bring me my mailbox key!  If you want someone who is going to get the job done and leave you happy in your new home, this is your guy!!!  Seriously, don't waste any more time, you will find no better than Nicolas G.",

I would recommend going into models sports and getting a pair of weight lifting gloves since those gloves have an extra layer that helps when climbing and the gloves cost $12. You can also buy a pair of gloves at treetop. You can't take your phone with you so if you have a go pro camera with the strap, bring that with you. You can purchase a pouch for your phone that is allowed on the course and pouch is $10 which is good for getting all the pictures and videos you want of your friends and family.In terms of food its best to bring your own lunch.",

I was totally left there, ignored and in severe pain with migraine for over 4 hours. There's more, but it just happened  this past week, and don't want to give it a red flag.\n\nEnded up being in surgery once getting to my room, I mean immediately, no time to think. I could not get my meds on time, they didn't care if I was hurting, couldn't walk, I just annoyed them as did my \"roommate.\"  The nurses were rude, broken english, nervous and come to find out, most were only there for 1-2 months. Umm, not good, and without supervision.\n\nOnce I was released, I realized I was NOT given instructions on how to care for my post-op stuff. They sent me home with paperwork, but ZERO instructions. Most doctors are \"hospitalists,\" so you cannot reach one.\n\nI tried calling this morning, and they only take calls (at the followup clinic) if you are going to make a follow-up appointment OR pay your bill!\n\nMy own primary card doctor just left the area, suddenly, and now I am left hanging with a Nor'easter on the way. I could go into sepsis, and do not know what to do.\n\nI WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN! Such a shame, we'll see if they even get $10.00 a month to pay my bill.\n\nAn utter DISGRACE to the region, it's integrity of the medical profession, and their patients. It's not the first time I had a problem, last time I had had chest pain (years ago) and was considered a cardiac patient. They took blood work, walked away, never came back, no monitoring, came back 8 hours later, told me to see my cardiologist.\n\nAVOID AT ALL COSTS!",

I came back in hope they have improved these issues and they have not so I now go to Funcho’s on Main Street which has the same food quality with better service. The seating is also very limited which is a struggle if you are there for a sit down meal. The worst part is almost every time I go there they get the order wrong.

But its a mismatch for the restaurant that she works in. We ordered 1 alcupuria, 1 papa rellena, the rabo (oxtail) and the arroz con pollo. The alcupuria tasted as if the root vegetable they used was not ripe or was used before it was ready. The side guisado sauce was too watery. The papa rellena was just ok. The oxtail was a major let down. Between it being made in a heavy tomato base verses a natural brown gravy the onions were uncooked. On the positive the white rice was good and so were the frijoles colorados. But the arroz con pollo was terrible. Frozen corn, string beans and diced carrots have no business being in the authentic classic dish. White chicken chunks were used in place of chicken meat on the bone which gives the dish so much more moisture and flavor. It was drowning in sweet peas as well. No pimento as a garnish to finish the classic. Avocado on either side was added but shouldn't have for the sake of those who have food allergies. I ordered a piece of cuero (pig skin cracklin') that comes off the pork shoulder which is supposed to be flavored with garlic and spices and is supposed to be to many a desired portion, a highlight-- a treat of a pernil dish. It was put in the friolator and delivered horribly burnt! How the chef put that out is unexplainable. My personal opinion when it comes to the type of items you place on your menu is that you should make it as authentic as the classic recipe. If you are a fusion or nouveau style restaurant let it be known in your name and your branding. I take great offense when a restaurant puts a twist on an authentic meal most specifically Hispanic food because you lose the authenticity in the translation of the dish. Additionally, pick a country and stick with it. Meaning if you want to sell Cuban sandwiches your menu should be all Cuban. Mixing the menu up to include Mexican tacos with Puerto Rican alcupurias and Colombian bandejas is reaching way to far. Stick to the classic recipes from one country and become an expert then you will not fail. The restaurant also needs a vestibule to control all the cold air that comes in from the doors.Hopefully they will change a few things around. Otherwise, I'm sorry but I don't see this restaurant sticking around for too long. I had such great hopes.",

My problem is that I was told that my alternator was the problem and was what was gonna keep killing my battery. My warranty company wouldn't allow my alternator to be changed because this Midas only offers a 90 day warranty on their alternators (which can't be helped) so i went to Jeep to get an extended warranty on it. When I got there, they had to run their own diagnosis and it came back saying nothing was wrong with my alternator. Could've saved $170...\n\nEdit: I just got a call from Midas and am very satisfied with the customer service. Although the diagnostic fee was from Jeep, I was offered mechanic services up to $220 for my troubles which is more than generous. I'm glad I can continue getting work on my car done here.",

They also forgot to bring us our appetizer until an hour later when they realized the order didn’t go through. The food itself is very salty. Also, the poor ventilation in the restaurant means that you’ll end up with smoke in your eyes so if you’re irritable, I’d steer clear.",

    "text": "First off, be ready to queue up for at least an hour and a half during lunch time on a Friday. Service is very slow, but very friendly. Overall the sandwiches are very good. But you have to ask yourself is any bagel worth almost a two-hour wait. All ingredients seem very tasty, and you may think it's worth it. The best way to go about this it's just order your sandwich online and pick it up that will save you the trouble. There is no table service here so keep that in mind when you come here. My biggest disappointments of the restaurant was that any hot sandwich is heated in the microwave. We were ready to have the Lox, and eggs and when we saw the ace being being in a tray and put into a microwave oh, that was a complete turn-off and opted for a cold sandwich. Yes, the bagels are amazing. I think probably one of the best that I've had in New York. You can see them being baked right in front of you once you're inside the deli. If you do not want to wait for a long time, just walk right in and buy your bagels only and take him home and do as you wish. When I come back? Yes, but only if I order ahead online I would not get in line again for a sandwich.",

Drive through team was prompt and courteous and still had patience after the half hour onslaught of over-heated, hungry and rushing workforce lunch-breakers and kids on summer break. And I'm sure that what I witnessed was just the tail end of it. If this were a review of the customers, subtract 4 stars. But, the food was hot and fries fresh and soft but not soggy. I asked for honey mustard and amazingly it was in the bag. So, for service and product as expected, I feel 5 stars is most appropriate. It is more often then not that I walk away with something to gripe about. Daily incidentals can drag down a mood and raise stress levels; It's wonderful when they're positive and uplifting but I'm always happy to settle for neutral. For the decent, forgettable experience I long for when buying lunch, this now tops my list. Thanks to the Wendy's employees.",

I really don't like banks that are not customer friendly, not towards the customer but more towards the protection of their money. I don't like calling customer service who can't answer my questions and keep passing you from one rep to another because they are higher up and MIGHT be able to answer my question. This is covid times here, scams are running wild. Chase is suppose to protect the customer, not by taking a pending check from another bank and clearing it, then reversing it 3 days later, wiping out their customers account. You are suppose to either keep it in pending so the customer doesn't take it or at very very least,  tell the customer this doesn't officially clear for 3 to 4 days. A few simple words go a long way. Please Chase rep, don't tell me these scams are common and happen, that doesn't make me happy. You're the bank, you know more details of the inner workings of the bank then me. Do more and refund my money, retrain your staff, protect the customer or just get out of the business and close shop. How many more people have to lose their money????",

Party of 5 people, we sit down, and we tell the waitress we all want bbq, no hot pot. I'm not sure if she just didn't understand, (her English wasn't great, my Cantonese is worse) but she basically insisted that we also needed to get hot-pot because the grill wouldn't be enough for all of us, even though we didn't really want it. As a result, our table is over-crowded with plates and a big pot that we didn't really want  in the first place. Made eating pretty difficult.  Not really worth it, even with the free meal for my birthday.",

There are at least three bars in it if you like, and there are VIP areas where you can sit on couches that are slightly elevated on the floor, so no straining to see over general admission.  Sometimes the music makes it hard to hear the lyrics but it's easy to see the stage no matter where you are. Definitely a favorite.  Seats are slightly narrow, so if you have a larger derriere, you may want to opt for the VIP seating.",

It said it should be delivered between 7:00-7:45pm okay I understand that I call 7:30 to see what’s going on since I’m only a 10 minute drive away from the restaurant and the lady says “Your food is ready but it’s going to be another hour so not I’m not getting my food till 8:30 . I ask the lady WHO WANTS COLD FOOD” And she has a very NASTY ATTITUDE. So at 7:40pm I cancel the order and order Popeyes     ‍♀️. I’m already in bed by 9pm because you know I’m tired or what ever why do I wake up this morning to text messages from 10:15 pm talking about the is Magic Sould Food we are outside with your delivery. Y’all really need to do better if business is “BOOMING” how y’all make it seem “HIRE ANOTHER DELIVERY DRIVER” Please do better 👌  ‼️ Ps. I wish there was a way to give no stars",

    "text": "100% DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!\n\nCRM picks and chooses what they feel like doing. They pride themselves on custom care but only pick who they will help or not.  It seems very clear that if not all these reviews are from the friends and business partners and not actual customers as I know firsthand how they tend to a customer. They are completely unprofessional, rude and do not listen to the needs of the actual homeowners and try to interpret the bylaws as they see fit even when faced with facts. They tend to deflect responsibility when the issue is tough. This is not a good sign of leadership. They try and play the game that they take pride in customer care and provide a service, but this is not the truth. When they don’t like what they hear even if its facts, they will cut you off on responding or downplay and deflect. They will deflect and say they are given directives by a Board to which they follow, however the bylaws are the management documents that must be followed!\n\nIf you are a homeowner for a property they manage, I would excise your right in a civil manner to asked them about the health of your community, financials, and any other important information as a stakeholder of your property to insure they are doing the right thing. I’m sure they will try to downplay this rating and your concerns!\n\nEdit/update: There response is typical and proves what I have stated above in there deflecting of what they don't like to hear or can't handle.",
