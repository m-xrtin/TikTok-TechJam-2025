I consider myself a foodie and a bit of a snob when it comes to food in general. The guy working the front counter was personable and actually pretty awesome. Did an incredible job promoting the food there and made great recommendations. I tried the ABC Burger, the volcano roll, the ninja fries, and the teriyaki bowl. All delicious. I’ll be back tomorrow as I am staying nearby in town and want to try more!\nI wish there was one back home.",

They had a great selection of drinks and that I guess would entice people to come and have a drink. The place was almost packed and I observed that other than us, all the other tables occupied were Caucasians. From my visitation to Japanese restaurants in America, if it was serving great Japanese food, you will see loads of Japanese/Asian people dining but Mamanoko was not the case.\n\nThe food was overall very salty and I would think it serves the palette of the patrons in this area of the restaurant. This is my very own objective review of the food I had, so you can make your own judgment when thinking of coming here.  We had the Tokyo Ramen, chicken yakitori, Sea Bento Box, and Umami Sliders. We had the house hot sake too and was sour.",

    "text": "This has got to be the worst excuse for a postal service I have ever seen. A complete joke. NONE of the postal workers ever actually deliver packages to your home. They instead drive around in their little car too lazy to get out and hand out pink \"Sorry we missed you slips\" to your mailbox. No knocking, no walking the ten feet it will take to place any package or letter on the front step - Just a slip and the incredibly inconvenient business hours for you to pick it up (Noon to 5pm Monday through Saturday -because screw anyone that has a job and these lazy a-holes can't be expected to work more than five hours.)  Want it redelivered? HA! We've tried that FIVE TIMES ! They were all returned to sender, even after scheduling a re-delivery the day after we received the slip.\nPlus they have already lost two of our packages despite the fact that tracking has them last known at their location.\nI periodically have to take time off work just to get a package that could easily fit into my mailbox (no signature required) and lose money because they refuse to do their jobs.\nThe post office location is filled with incompetence - they also have little remorse for you and your missed packages (missed birthday presents, medicine, work related items, time-sensitive materials - they don't care). Worst part is, they don't have to actually do their jobs or care about anything because they are a government job and bad customer reviews don't affect them (I mean just look at how many one stars they have on Google and Yelp).\nFinally, don't waste your time trying to call them, they never pick up and their answering machine is always full.\nJust poor excuse for a postal service and poor excuse for workers.",

I asked for plain hot butter, and got it not fully hot. It started hardening. WHITE rice is not white rice. Lol. It looked like brown rice with some veggies in it. 😳 we had the known shrimp with veggies mix, although seasoning IS slightly different too, it was still good. The bread was the only thing that was still really good. I love freshly steamed seafood, but because I didn’t like their butter, I had the crab legs by itself and it was not as fresh tasting which could mean it’s frozen seafood. Will have to go close to the sea to get fresh seafood. Would I go back? Yes, for the shrimp mix and to try the sandwiches? I know change is good, but there are some things best left alone, like HOT, melted, plain butter and plain white rice! Lol",

I came in about an hour before closing and my stylist just wanted to get me out. After less then ten minutes and using the scissors for maybe one minute, my stylist claimed to be ‘done’. After he claimed to have finished, I had to tell him twice to take more off but he insisted that all I needed was product - which he didn’t even offer. I also asked him to thin out the top, which he did not do. The $23 I spent was not worth the ten minute, careless haircut I received. I’ll have to go someplace else to have my haircut fixed.",

The lobby has a great sitting area with large windows looking over a peaceful, well maintained garden. The staff is very professional and knowledgeable. We stayed in a \"kids suite\", boy what a great idea! The kids had their own room, bunkbeds, and television. The mini fridge and microwave were a big help. The pool was awesome! Nothing fancy, but definitely nice and well maintained, newer outdoor furniture, warm, had plenty of towels available at all times and the best part is that it had two shallow ends! Plenty of room to play for the little ones. The only thing we didn't like was the crowded breakfast area. More staff is needed to keep the place clean and stocked. On another note, there was a good variety of food to choose from. There was always plenty of shaded parking, but you have to pay $10.99 per day so you can park on the property. We've never had to pay to park at a hotel we already paid to stay in.",

We shared the butternut squash pizza - the squash was perfectly cooked, not too soggy, not raw. The goat cheese was creamy, the pine nuts crunchy, and the crust was soft but still crisp enough on the bottom to hold up.\n\nI'd love to come another time and order some non pizza items!",

The process was very smooth and straight forward, I put in the inquiry, they called me within the hour and my appointment was scheduled, just like that! The best part is I missed my first appointment because I was running late; however Ely was very friendly and was able to see me same day at a later time. I’ve had my car for about a week now and I love it! Shoutout to my man Ely! He was laid back and made the process much more comfortable for me.",

The order took a while to complete but my number came up. Normally I wouldn't bother to check my order but as it was quite large my husband and I checked through it at the nearest table. Instead of total six sides I had five, and instead of 16 pieces of chicken I had only 8!!!!!  I took my receipt and complaint to the counter. To my surprise no one asked to check my order, there was no apology from the staff, no one took the person who packed my order aside and asked them what happened. It was as though no one was surprized that I was complaining. What would have happened had I not checked the order and had driven the 15 minutes home and then come back???  An assistant did pack me 8 pieces of chicken, these were perhaps the smallest pieces she could find.\nUnfortunately there aren't any other KFC nearby. I shall not be a frequent customer to this location in Culver Drive and I suggest that any customer who does go there checks their order to see that they are not being short changed as the stores lack of concern makes me think this is common practise at this restaurant.",

They mostly accept coupons, and take orders very fast. But, you have to wait in line for drive-thru before you receive your order. They give your food orders complete. One of good places to buy food in a hurry.",

Samosa was OK-ish.\nWe ordered :\nGarlic naans- Bigger than regular size, good right?\nBegan Barta- looks like dal fry, rarely tasted like began barta.\nChicken Tikka Masala- Like sweetened tikka masala. Nah!\nChicken Biryani- Close to cooker style pulav, chicken was good though.\n\nOverall a 3 star rating for keeping the Indian flavor alive in Santa Rosa and humble service.",

She told us to sit wherever knowing there was literally no tables open. I understand they were busy but she didn't even try and clean any off for us. My husband and I were both standing there looking for a table and just went back to the front to wait. Then, a couple in their 40's came in and stood behind us. The same waitress greeted them and immediately started cleaning off a table for them! Since I saw she was cleaning off the table I proceeded to sit myself . Little did I know she was cleaning off the table for that couple and that couple only that came in AFTER us ! She even told the man \"I can sit you right here\" , which I didn't hear in the moment. My husband saw while I was sitting at the table that she kept staring at me and making faces because I guess I wasn't supposed to sit there?? We had gotten there first , no one tried to clean a table off for us and we felt very unacknowledged! Keep in mind my husband and I are both in our 20's and I too am pregnant but she favored the other couple. We felt misjudged and not welcomed at all. It's unfortunate that we experienced this because we were looking forward to having a new spot to go to. Very disappointed!",

There were about 20-25 people standing in line already. The sweet security lady greeted us and recommended we do the paperwork online on our smartphones to speed up the processing; we all did. The staff made sure we're in the right line, with the appropriate documentation, and inside before they even opened. At 8am, the numbers on the screen started rolling quickly. I was done before 8:30am. Everyone I encountered there was very professional, courteous, and helpful. I'll definitely use this branch in the future when I need the DMV.",

It consisted of removing existing deck, concrete & lot of dirt, leveling it nicely and putting pavers from the front door and in entire backyard. First let me say that Brandon Borrego, Walther and his crew did an outstanding job. Brandon was able to interpret what we wanted and ensured to put the plan within our budget. Walther is straight up, honest and kept us updated on everything. Special call out to Fernando as he was exceedingly dedicated and was ensuring everything is done perfectly. Rest of the crew was courteous, skillful and really done great job. The final walk through was perfect and everything was cleaned up when they finished.\nWonderful value for the money we invested. We would highly recommend this company for any project.",

Beef brisket  on a soft roll with a huge side of fries knocks it out of the park. There is substantial history here, noting the multitude of pictures and knick knacks that are mounted on all of the walls. The owner came by to chat briefly, and apparently that is a regular thing to expect here. Wonderful place. Would recommend and would return. $25.00 for two beef brisket sandwiches and two sides with water to drink.",
