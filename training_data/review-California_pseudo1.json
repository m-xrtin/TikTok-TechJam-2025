    "text": "They tried to find ways to charge me more. It did not feel right when I was charged $55 at first only to tell me that my car was not ready for the Smog because it looks like someone worked on my car recently and disconnected the battery. The last car maintennance I had and the last people who touched my Honda car were last month with the Honda Dealership itself, so I asked them about it and they said they did not even touch nor disconnected anything. Then, the guy at the front desk told me to drive my car 40 more miles and go back to them with $20 to get the certificate. I came back and was asked if I drove 40 miles and I said more than that because I work every day and drive about a total of 40 minutes each day to work and back. Then, they said my car was still not ready and asked if they could just drive my car around so I let them. The guy who drove my car came back and said it's finally ready but he only drove 2 miles. Seriously?? That's already a total of more than 50 miles total this week since they asked me to drive 40. I was charged about $28 with a total of $83 to pass my car for Smog. It looks and feels like people in the business are taking advantage of this COVID situation. They were NOT even wearing a mask when they are supposed to, NO sign stating everyone must be 6 ft apart, NO sanitizers, NO other signs that the Corona Virus, per state, policies are being enforced, and the chairs inside where the customers sit are next to each other without space. I would hate to have this business closed down for not enforcing health protocols, so Im not coming back to this place instead and write a review to give a heads up to those citizens who care about the situation. If you don't care, then this review is not for you.",

Said it would be one day and the car was ready with a car to let me know by 820 the next morning. Got the rental exchanged and Jason and team in service had my car washed and out to me in record time. Both experiences were outstanding;unlike some I've had in past with other deslerships.

The decor was unique and not typical of most Asian restaurants, the menu had so many varieties of sushi and Specialty rolls and the food was delicious. What they are lacking is good service. I ordered a dinner which came with soup and salad. My friends got their order long before I got mine and when mine finally arrived it was Sushi not my soup and salad which I had to ask for. I also had to ask for Wasabi and gari (ginger) which always comes with sushi. They burned my specialty roll so I had to wait even longer to get that and because of that they gave us a very lovely free dessert for which I thank them. They also gave one of my friends a free glass of plum wine. That was good management. While the wait staff is very pleasant, they did not do their jobs well at all. I left a 10% tip as did my friends. It's really a shame as this could have easily become one of my favorite sushi restaurants.",

While this place is somewhat Americanized, it still has that Brazilian charm, with friendly service and delicious food, especially the cooked pineapple sprinkled with cinnamon! The fried bananas, selection of cheeses at the salad bar, and the bacon-wrapped chicken are also favorites. Oh and you have to try the Brazilian cheesebread and Guarana! But be sure to save room for the passion fruit mousse - so packed with flavor it's best to share. Our waitress, Josie, was so nice and had excellent timing all night.",

First the agent who showed us the house didn't even give us a tour of the house, he just opened the front door and waited outside and showed no interest in the fact that we loved the house. After applying for the house we found that even their office workers were lazy and impossible to get any response from for information, except for \"I'll check\" and \"We will get back to you tomorrow\" which they never did get back to us. After being told for a week that all they had to do was a previous landlord reference I called our past landlord and asked if they had received any calls or messages and they told us they had not. I called and confronted the lady in the office and she told me that she had been trying to call and when I told her I had talked to my past landlord she started stuttering and backtracking her story and while \"umm\" and \"uhh\" became her new favorite words she said once again \"I'll check on it and get back to you tomorrow.\" Finally after they screwed up the first contract by forgetting information that was on our application and that we had told them over and over again,we rejected the second contract and decided to go elsewhere.",

    "text": "(Translated by Google) I live in LA K-town\nI stopped by Torrance H mart with my husband yesterday\nSome Jujeon Beak and Orange Juice...\nI was thirsty, so I drank orange juice right away\nMy husband drank a little and gave me our daughter in the back seat\n(For reference, my daughter is 34 months old and I am in the hospital)\nThe moment the child put his mouth on to drink, I saw something strange in my eyes.\nIt was strange that I took it away so I couldn't eat it. When I checked it, I found that mold was growing at the entrance to drink. I called the mart because I was so embarrassed that there is no manager and I will return the juice so I ask you to come ㅎㅎㅎ Does this make sense in common sense??\nI left my phone number but no contact came. I will be apologized for doing everything I can from next Monday.\nI think it's really wrong to respond to customers like this at a small mart in the United States. Customers are not Hogu.\n\n(Original)\n저는 LA K- town 살고있습니다\n어제 남편과 함께 토랜스 h mart 에 들려\n주전부리몇게와 오렌지주스 등..\n저는 목이 말랐던 터라 오렌지주스를 바로 마셨고\n남편은 조금마시고 뒷자리에 있던 저희 딸을 줬습니다\n(참고로 저희딸은34개월이고 저는 입신중입니다)\n아이가 마시려고 입을대는 순간 제눈에 이상한것이 보였습니다\n이상해서 일단 못먹게 뺏어서 확인해보니 마시는 입구에 곰팡이가 핀것을 확인했고 너무 황당해서 마트에 전화를 했더니 메니저는 없고 주스값 돌려줄테니까 오라고 하네요 ㅎㅎㅎ 이게 상식적으로 말이 됩니까??\n전화번호 남겼놨는데도 불구하고 연락은 오지 않았습니다 저는 돌아오는 월요일부터 제가 할수 있는 모든것을 해서라고 사과를 받을것 입니다\n미국에서 작지 않은 마트에서 이런식으로 손님응대 하는것은 정말 잘못됐다고 생각합니다 손님이 호구는 아닙니다",

    "text": "An accident waiting to happen?\n\nOur home warranty company, First American Life, hired Poe's plumbing to fix our hot water heater in Santa Cruz, CA.  Not too long after they fixed it, we smelled gas.  Poe's came back out and said everything looked fine.\n\nWe had to call in PG&E who told us that when Poe's plumbing installed a new controller, they didn't tighten it down.  That's right -- 2 visits to our house, tepid or cold showers for too long, and a nerve-wracking scent of gas in our garage, and then the simplest step skipped and overlooked upon re-inspection....yikes! Very glad they didn't blow our house up.\n\nMy recommendation? use a different plumber.  Sorry I don't remember the name of the person who did our work, so at the very least I could advise you \"don't let (this person) do the work.\"",

From the moment I stepped into the building it was a delight. Elizabeth the specialty coordinator, greeted me right away as if I were a member of their family.  Very helpful and very knowledgeable. Elizabeth was so nice. She answered all my questions. I never felt rushed. She took care of me. Then there is Courtney my hygienist. Most of the times most hygienists will talk to you while your mouth is stuffed; unable to respond. And they expect you to reply or have a full conversation with them…Really! It has never made any sense to me. But Courtney is not like that. She will have a conversation but after the fact or if need be when I the patient is able to respond. Plus she was gentle.\n\nOVERALL GREAT EXPERICENCE! GREAT STAFF. VERY CLEAN OFFICE AND HAS THE STATE OF THE ART EQUIPMENT.",

I don't usually see the same employees more than once or twice so I think that there is a high turnover. The staff that work there seem a bit overworked and spread thin. They're generally friendly but also generally not around for assistance either. They sell great balloons and I think they could do even more if they had more helium tanks and another person, especially at graduation time etc. We waited 2 and 1/2 hours for 3 simple Mylar balloons ( not in the store, and we didnt need them In a rush so it was okay-ish, but we had to go back to work and then stop back by on break). The cashier line is slow mainly because they usually only have one. It's a Party City but I dont have another to at this time...however the dollar store is faster for balloons.",

Everything has always been outstanding. They have perfected combining distinct complimentary flavors, and each dish actually tastes as exciting as the menu description makes it sound. I've never been disappointed with a single thing I've put in my mouth here, and I never leave with buyers remorse. The food and experience are totally worth the price if you want to go out for a nice dinner. Favorites are BBQ butterfly prawns, ahi poke, macadamia crusted mahi mahi with lobster sauce, and the pineapple martini!",

The reviews were good but the room was even better. The fridge and microwave were invaluable, since I was trying to avoid eating in the in-park restaurants, and stopping by the grocery store nearby made for easy meals. The free breakfast was GREAT and much appreciated. The room was clean and generously sized for a hotel of this price level. The furnishings were maybe a little outdated but who’s complaining?\n\nThe location was also great, an easy hour from the central parking lot of the Yosemite Village/Ahwahnee area in the national park. The hotel is right on the major road that takes you into the park, and also conveniently across the street from a gas station (you burn a lot of gas in Yosemite).\n\nThe staff was knowledgeable about the park and the Mariposa area. I also have to thank them for helping me jump-start my car when my battery died one morning.\n\nThe one negative was the very spotty wifi, but that seemed to be a problem everywhere in the area. And who really goes to Yosemite to use the internet anyway?\n\nI would definitely stay at the Miner’s Inn again and would recommend it to anyone.",

There is always something exciting to do.  Each building has an exterior lounge area with a view of the marina, and this is perfect for relaxing and entertaining. There are also resident events like Karaoke, Wine nights, and Doggie Days during the month. My favorite thing to do is to go to the gym. The gym is on three levels; the first level is the weight floor, the second floor is cardio equipment, and the third level host weekly fitness classes like HITT, yoga, body conditioning, boot camp, and spin.\n\nI have no regrets with signing a lease at AMLI except I wish I scheduled a tour sooner than later in my search for a new place. Moving is stressful. The staff here is the best, and they make sure you have the best experience. I toured the property with leasing office representative, Rhoshana. I'm grateful I met her because she is actively engaged in the AMLI activities. It's nice to see a familiar face when you are new. She is always at the resident events and in the gym.\n\nI'm happy to call AMLI Marina Del Rey, my home! I would recommend this property to my friends, family, or anyone else who is considering relocation.",

You would think that since there is a shortage of water in California that they would go fix it right away, but that is not the case. Hopefully they will fix it soon so they stop wasting water.

    "text": "The staff and Dr. Chaudhary were amazing and we are grateful to them. However the male vet I assume the owner was absolutely awful and completely disrespectful. We had brought our older dog in and saw Dr. Chaudhary who made us feel comfortable and helped us look at options for our dog as we knew it was coming to an end. Once we knew she couldn’t walk anymore and was in so much pain we decided to put her down, not something we came to lightly as are pets our are family. We made the appointment and to our surprise we had the male vet (again I believe is the owner). He didn’t introduce himself and very business like told us the procedure. We had our son with us as we had discussed this in length with him the process and he was there just over a year ago when our other dog had a tumor coming out of his body and we had to put him down. That process went as well as can be expected when you lose a family member. Once the vet came back in he said nothing and jammed the sedative into our dog. She yelped, our son rightfully so screamed and hid. My husband and I were in shock no compassion as well. This traumatized all of us. As our son was hiding the vet proceeded to tell us our “son was too young to see this and he needed to leave”. We did not let our son leave we calmed him down and went through this loss as a family. This was a hard experience to begin with and we did not need to be traumatized by this. The doctor came back shortly with the papers to show us the difference between prices and than came back and gave her the last IV to put her down. Not once did he introduce himself, or tell us he was sorry for our loss. This was such a horrible experience I would never go back unless I knew he was not there and if he’s the owner I would never go back at all. He had no compassion for us as a family or even to our dog. Not only do we have to grieve as a family but we also have to move through this unnecessary traumatic event! I will be sharing this experience with the community!",

It was like he was watching over every single bite we took, just staring and observing...like can we please eat at peace? We also asked him for garlic and he gave us like 1 clove of garlic cut into 3 pieces. It’s insane! Like are we supposed to split this, each person gets a tiny piece of the garlic? Thank god  the staff noticed, took the small plate and gave us a good amount. Amazing place, food, and staff service. I just hope the owner can maybe stay behind the counter and let his customers eat peacefully.",

My hair's fine texture has confounded many a stylist and resulted in wispy and unmanageable cuts elsewhere, but Anthony knows exactly how to shape my hair so it looks great from the day of the cut all the way until next time I have an appointment, even if I schedule it late! I've been ecstatic with the results since the very first time he cut my hair a few years ago. He's a master, and a surprisingly rare find in a city like SF.\n\nHe just recently moved to Salon Yuni, a bright, modern and welcoming salon just off Fillmore in Pacific Heights.\n\nThe salon is lovely and comfortabl, with tons of natural light streaming in from skylights. The place is surrounded by cute boutiques and great restaurants and within walking distance of Japantown, so it's easy to plan a saturday around getting an amazing new haircut at Salon Yuni, even if you don't live in the neighborhood. Everyone who works there is friendly and accommodating and the prices of services and products were quite reasonable for a high-end place like Salon Yuni.",

    "text": "I've gotten 4 out of my 5 piercings here and when friends ask me about where to get a piercing this is always the place I recommend. There are a few good shops in the area but The Exotic Body still stands out from the rest thanks to level of experience & profesionalism the staff have.\n\nThe owner can come across as a bit no-nonsense at times which I think can be off-putting to some people, but from my perspective it's really a good thing. The staff are all positive people with a good sense of humor, they just have a preference for responsible nonsense. Which is what you want from someone who's about to stab a needle through part of your body.\n\nIt's clear that the owner, and all the staff, not only love what they do but take it seriously. They understand that the art forms they practice create a permanent change to their clients bodies & come with risks, and because they understand this they make sure that everything's done right.\n\nThe place is always clean, they have ideal sterilization practices, they teach you about aftercare, they advocate the use of safe jewlery materials & design, and they help their customers to make informed decisions and  get through the piercing process as easily & painlessly as possible.\n\nIt is a little more expensive than other shops in the area, but not by a lot. In my opinion it's worth it for the quality & sense of security you get by going to such a top notch place. I trust the staff here and have always had positive experiences with them.\n\nI've had piercings done here by both Samantha & Mike. Sam did my tongue piercing and my helix piercing & Mike did both of my genital piercings. They both did a fantastic job and (obviously) made a repeat customer out of me. I'll be going back here when it's time for my next piercing, and I recommend that anyone else who's looking to get a piercing choose The Exotic Body as well.",

Went yesterday for a quick bite and drink with friend and I couldn't wait to get out of there. Sadly the menu has changed and not nearly as exciting as the menu was before. Certainly not what you'd expect at a Hyatt. It was busy, that's a good thing, but they done nothing to help accoustically and the noise was so loud it was impossible to talk. Very pleasant server took our order for snack, after 20 minutes of waiting, we made our way through the crowd and told the servers we just wanted our check for our drinks and to leave. If you are 20something and enjoy very crowded, small, loud places and don't mind waiting forever for your food, go for it, but I wouldn't it to anyone and we won't go back. recommend it to anyone. Sadly not much good to say except servers were friendly.",

    "text": "Very bad food..and also bad service. My kid got a grilled cheese cold cheese not even melted. They put jalapenos in the cheese didn't even state in the menu that it comes with jalapenos. They gave us horchata that was really old and it tasted and smelled disgusting. For the price I expect they offer home made tortilla like other restaurants with authentic good quality Mexican food. The waitress was clueless in how to attend people she does not know how to speak to customers. Waste of time and money. No effort in the way they make their food bad taste just over all one of the worst places I've ever ate.",
